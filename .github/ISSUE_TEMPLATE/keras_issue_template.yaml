        Please make sure this issue is valid bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with the documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
        
        **Here's why we have that policy:**.
        
        Keras developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem.
