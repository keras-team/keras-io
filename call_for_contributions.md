# Call for code example contributions

This is a constantly-updated list of code examples that we're currently interested in.

## Timeseries forecasting with LSTM for weather prediction

Recommendations:

- Use `timeseries_dataset_from_array` for data processing
- Single LSTM layer + classification layer, trained with `fit()`
- Add nice visualizations


## StyleGAN / StyleGAN2

[Reference paper 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948) [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958)
[Reference TF implementation](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)


## End-to-end OCR (currently WIP)

This example is currently being worked on by @parthivc and @joshuacwnewton through the MLH Fellowship

[Old Keras example](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/image_ocr.py)

Recommendations:

- Use CTC loss
- Can use either Transformer model or recurrent model (whichever works best)



## Improve next-frame prediction with ConvLSTM

[Current example](https://keras.io/examples/vision/conv_lstm/)

Recommendations:

- Find a better, more interesting dataset
- Make it work better
- Add detailed explanations
