# KerasHub Models

KerasHub contains end-to-end implementations of popular model architectures.
These models can be created in two ways:

- Through the `from_preset()` constructor, which instantiates an object with
  a pre-trained configurations, vocabularies, and (optionally) weights.
- Through custom configuration controlled by the user.

For the full list of available presets shipped directly by the Keras team, see
the [Presets page](/keras_hub/presets/)
