# KerasHub Model Architectures

The following is a  list of model architectures supported by KerasHub. These
models can be created in two ways:

- Through the `from_preset()` constructor, which instantiates an object with
  a pre-trained configurations, vocabularies, and weights.
- Through custom configuration controlled by the user.

For the full list of available pretrained model presets shipped directly by the
Keras team, see the [Pretrained Models](/keras_hub/presets/) page.
