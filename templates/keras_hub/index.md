**KerasHub** is a pretrained modeling library that aims to be simple, flexible,
and fast. The library provides [Keras 3](https://keras.io/keras_3/)
implementations of popular model architectures, paired with a collection of
pretrained checkpoints available on [Kaggle Models](https://kaggle.com/models/).
Models can be use for both training and inference, on any of the TensorFlow,
Jax, and Torch backends.

KerasHub is an extension of the core Keras API; KerasHub components are provide
as [`Layers`](/api/layers/) and [`Models`](/api/models/). If you are familiar
with Keras, congratulations! You already understand most of KerasHub.

See our [Getting Started guide](/guides/keras_hub/getting_started)
to start learning our API. We welcome
[contributions](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/issues/1835).

## Installation

To install the latest KerasHub release with Keras 3, simply run:

```
pip install --upgrade keras-hub
```

To install the latest nightly changes for both KerasHub and Keras, you can use
our nightly package.

```
pip install --upgrade keras-hub-nightly
```

Note that currently, installing KerasHub will always pull in TensorFlow for use
of the `tf.data` API for preprocessing. Even when pre-processing with `tf.data`,
training can still happen on any backend.

Read [Getting started with Keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/) for more
information on installing Keras 3 and compatibility with different frameworks.

**Note:** We recommend using KerasHub with TensorFlow 2.16 or later, as TF 2.16
packages Keras 3 by default.

## Quickstart

Below is a quick example using ResNet to predict an image, and BERT to train a
classifier:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"  # Or "tensorflow" or "torch"!

import keras
import keras_hub
import numpy as np
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load a ResNet model.
classifier = keras_hub.models.ImageClassifier.from_preset(
    "resnet_50_imagenet",
    activation="softmax",
)
# Predict a label for a single image.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/California_quail.jpg"
image_path = keras.utils.get_file(origin=image_url)
image = keras.utils.load_img(image_path)
batch = np.array([image])
preds = classifier.predict(batch)
print(keras_hub.utils.decode_imagenet_predictions(preds))

# Load a BERT model.
classifier = keras_hub.models.BertClassifier.from_preset(
    "bert_base_en_uncased",
    activation="softmax",
    num_classes=2,
)

# Fine-tune on IMDb movie reviews.
imdb_train, imdb_test = tfds.load(
    "imdb_reviews",
    split=["train", "test"],
    as_supervised=True,
    batch_size=16,
)
classifier.fit(imdb_train, validation_data=imdb_test)
# Predict two new examples.
preds = classifier.predict(
    ["What an amazing movie!", "A total waste of my time."]
)
print(preds)
```

## Compatibility

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and plan to
provide backwards compatibility guarantees both for code and saved models built
with our components. While we continue with pre-release `0.y.z` development, we
may break compatibility at any time and APIs should not be consider stable.

## Disclaimer

KerasHub provides access to pre-trained models via the `keras_hub.models` API.
These pre-trained models are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties
or conditions of any kind.
