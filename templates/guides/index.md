# Developer guides

Our developer guides are deep-dives into specific topics such as layer subclassing, fine-tuning, or model saving.
They're one of the best ways to become a Keras expert.

Most of our guides are written as Jupyter notebooks and can be run in one click in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb),
a hosted notebook environment that requires no setup and runs in the cloud. Google Colab includes GPU and TPU runtimes.
