    "## Wait, how does this even work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike what you might expect at this point, StableDiffusion doesn't actually run on magic.\n",
    "It's a kind of \"latent diffusion model\". Let's dig into what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with the idea of _super-resolution_:\n",
    "it's possible to train a deep learning model to _denoise_ an input image -- and thereby turn it into a higher-resolution\n",
    "version. The deep learning model doesn't do this by magically recovering the information that's missing from the noisy, low-resolution\n",
    "input -- rather, the model uses its training data distribution to hallucinate the visual details that would be most likely\n",
    "given the input. To learn more about super-resolution, you can check out the following Keras.io tutorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Image Super-Resolution using an Efficient Sub-Pixel CNN](https://keras.io/examples/vision/super_resolution_sub_pixel/)\n",
    "- [Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for single-image super-resolution](https://keras.io/examples/vision/edsr/)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Super-resolution](https://i.imgur.com/M0XdqOo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you push this idea to the limit, you may start asking -- what if we just run such a model on pure noise?\n",
    "The model would then \"denoise the noise\" and start hallucinating a brand new image. By repeating the process multiple\n",
    "times, you can get turn a small patch of noise into an increasingly clear and high-resolution artificial picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key idea of latent diffusion, proposed in\n",
    "[High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) in 2020.\n",
    "To understand diffusion in depth, you can check the Keras.io tutorial\n",
    "[Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models](https://keras.io/examples/generative/ddim/).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Denoising diffusion](https://i.imgur.com/FSCKtZq.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to go from latent diffusion to a text-to-image system,\n",
    "you still need to add one key feature: the ability to control the generated visual contents via prompt keywords.\n",
    "This is done via \"conditioning\", a classic deep learning technique which consists of concatenating to the\n",
    "noise patch a vector that represents a bit of text, then training the model on a dataset of {image: caption} pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to the Stable Diffusion architecture. Stable Diffusion consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A text encoder, which turns your prompt into a latent vector.\n",
    "- A diffusion model, which repeatedly \"denoises\" a 64x64 latent image patch.\n",
    "- A decoder, which turns the final 64x64 latent patch into a higher-resolution 512x512 image.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, your text prompt gets projected into a latent vector space by the text encoder,\n",
    "which is simply a pretrained, frozen language model. Then that prompt vector is concatenated\n",
    "to a randomly generated noise patch, which is repeatedly \"denoised\" by the diffusion model over a series\n",
    "of \"steps\" (the more steps you run the clearer and nicer your image will be -- the default value is 50 steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the 64x64 latent image is sent through the decoder to properly render it in high resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Stable Diffusion architecture](https://i.imgur.com/2uC8rYJ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All-in-all, it's a pretty simple system -- the Keras implementation\n",
    "fits in four files that represent less than 500 lines of code in total:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [text_encoder.py](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv/blob/master/keras_cv/models/stable_diffusion/text_encoder.py): 87 LOC\n",
