    "## What is AWQ?\n",
    "\n",
    "AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) is a post-training, weight-only\n",
    "quantization method that uses activation statistics to identify and protect\n",
    "salient weights during quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of AWQ is that not all weights are equally important: a small\n",
    "fraction of weights (typically <1%) are \"salient\" because they process\n",
    "channels with large activation magnitudes. By protecting these weights from\n",
    "quantization error, AWQ preserves model quality while achieving significant\n",
    "compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike GPTQ which uses second-order (Hessian-based) optimization, AWQ uses a\n",
    "simpler grid search to find per-channel scales that minimize activation-weighted\n",
    "quantization error. This makes AWQ generally faster while achieving competitive\n",
    "accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run a small calibration set through the model to collect per-channel\n",
    "  activation magnitudes.\n",
    "2. For each weight matrix, search for optimal per-channel scales that\n",
    "   minimize activation-weighted quantization error.\n",
    "3. Multiply weights by the optimal scales before quantization\n",
    "  (expanding salient weights).\n",
    "4. Quantize the scaled weights to 4-bit (or other supported bit-width) integers.\n",
    "5. During inference, dequantize weights and divide by scales to\n",
    "   restore original magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale formula uses: `scales = activation_max^ratio` where ratio is\n",
    "searched over a grid from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras supports AWQ quantization for KerasHub models via the\n",
    "`keras.quantizers.AWQConfig` class."

    "\n",
    "* AWQ is a post-training technique; training after quantization is not supported.\n",
    "* Always use the model's own tokenizer for calibration.\n",
