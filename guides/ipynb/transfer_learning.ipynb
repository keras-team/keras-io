    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transfer learning** consists of taking features learned on one problem, and\n",
    "leveraging them on a new, similar problem. For instance, features from a model that has\n",
    "learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify\n",
    " tanukis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to\n",
    " train a full-scale model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the\n",
    " following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take layers from a previously trained model.\n",
    "2. Freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during\n",
    " future training rounds.\n",
    "3. Add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers. They will learn to turn\n",
    " the old features into predictions on a  new dataset.\n",
    "4. Train the new layers on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A last, optional step, is **fine-tuning**, which consists of unfreezing the entire\n",
    "model you obtained above (or part of it), and re-training it on the new data with a\n",
    "very low learning rate. This can potentially achieve meaningful improvements, by\n",
    " incrementally adapting the pretrained features to the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will go over the Keras `trainable` API in detail, which underlies most\n",
    " transfer learning & fine-tuning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll demonstrate the typical workflow by taking a model pretrained on the\n",
    "ImageNet dataset, and retraining it on the Kaggle \"cats vs dogs\" classification\n",
    " dataset.\n",

    "## The typical transfer-learning workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to how a typical transfer learning workflow can be implemented in Keras:\n",

    "1. Instantiate a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.\n",
    "2. Freeze all layers in the base model by setting `trainable = False`.\n",
    "3. Create a new model on top of the output of one (or several) layers from the base\n",

    "Note that an alternative, more lightweight workflow could also be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.\n",
    "2. Run your new dataset through it and record the output of one (or several) layers\n",
    " from the base model. This is called **feature extraction**.\n",
    "3. Use that output as input data for a new, smaller model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of that second workflow is that you only run the base model once on\n",
    " your data, rather than once per epoch of training. So it's a lot faster & cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue with that second workflow, though, is that it doesn't allow you to dynamically\n",

    "data augmentation, for instance. Transfer learning is typically used for tasks when\n",
    "your new dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch, and in\n",
    "such scenarios data augmentation is very important. So in what follows, we will focus\n",
    " on the first workflow.\n",
