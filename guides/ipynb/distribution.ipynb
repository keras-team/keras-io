    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras distribution API is a new interface designed to facilitate\n",
    "distributed deep learning across a variety of backends like JAX, TensorFlow and\n",
    "PyTorch. This powerful API introduces a suite of tools enabling data and model\n",
    "parallelism, allowing for efficient scaling of deep learning models on multiple\n",
    "accelerators and hosts. Whether leveraging the power of GPUs or TPUs, the API\n",
    "provides a streamlined approach to initializing distributed environments,\n",
    "defining device meshes, and orchestrating the layout of tensors across\n",
    "computational resources. Through classes like `DataParallel` and\n",
    "`ModelParallel`, it abstracts the complexity involved in parallel computation,\n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras distribution API provides a global programming model that allows\n",
    "developers to compose applications that operate on tensors in a global context\n",
    "(as if working with a single device) while\n",
    "automatically managing distribution across many devices. The API leverages the\n",
    "underlying framework (e.g. JAX) to distribute the program and tensors according to the\n",
    "sharding directives through a procedure called single program, multiple data\n",
    "(SPMD) expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "By decoupling the application from sharding directives, the API enables running\n",
    "the same application on a single device, multiple devices, or even multiple\n",
    "clients, while preserving its global semantics."
