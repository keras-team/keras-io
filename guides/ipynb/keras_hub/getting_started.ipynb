    "## API Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, let's take a look at the key classes we will use in the KerasHub library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task**: e.g., `keras_hub.models.CausalLM`, `keras_hub.models.ImageClassifier`, and\n",
    "`keras_hub.models.TextClassifier`.\n",
    "  * **What it does**: A task maps from raw image, audio, and text inputs to model\n",
    "    predictions.\n",
    "  * **Why it's important**: A task is the highest-level entry point to the KerasHub API. It\n",
    "    encapsulates both preprocessing and modeling into a single, easy-to-use class. Tasks can\n",
    "    be used both for fine-tuning and inference.\n",
    "  * **Has a**: `backbone` and `preprocessor`.\n",
    "  * **Inherits from**: `keras.Model`.\n",
    "* **Backbone**: `keras_hub.models.Backbone`.\n",
    "  * **What it does**: Maps preprocessed tensor inputs to the latent space of the model.\n",
    "  * **Why it's important**: The backbone encapsulates the architecture and parameters of a\n",
    "    pretrained models in a way that is unspecialized to any particular task. A backbone can\n",
    "    be combined with arbitrary preprocessing and \"head\" layers mapping dense features to\n",
    "    predictions to accomplish any ML task.\n",
    "  * **Inherits from**: `keras.Model`.\n",
    "* **Preprocessor**: e.g.,`keras_hub.models.CausalLMPreprocessor`,\n",
    "  `keras_hub.models.ImageClassifierPreprocessor`, and\n",
    "  `keras_hub.models.TextClassifierPreprocessor`.\n",
    "  * **What it does**: A preprocessor maps from raw image, audio and text inputs to\n",
    "    preprocessed tensor inputs.\n",
    "  * **Why it's important**: A preprocessing layer encapsulates all tasks specific\n",
    "    preprocessing, e.g. image resizing and text tokenization, in a way that can be used\n",
    "    standalone to precompute preprocessed inputs. Note that if you are using a high-level\n",
    "    task class, this preprocessing is already baked in by default.\n",
    "  * **Has a**: `tokenizer`, `audio_converter`, and/or `image_converter`.\n",
    "  * **Inherits from**: `keras.layers.Layer`.\n",
    "* **Tokenizer**: `keras_hub.tokenizers.Tokenizer`.\n",
    "  * **What it does**: Converts strings to sequences of token ids.\n",
    "  * **Why it's important**: The raw bytes of a string are an inefficient representation of\n",
    "    text input, so we first map string inputs to integer token ids. This class encapsulated\n",
    "    the mapping of strings to ints and the reverse (via the `detokenize()` method).\n",
    "  * **Inherits from**: `keras.layers.Layer`.\n",
    "* **ImageConverter**: `keras_hub.layers.ImageConverter`.\n",
    "  * **What it does**: Resizes and rescales image input.\n",
    "  * **Why it's important**: Image models often need to normalize image inputs to a specific\n",
    "    range, or resizing inputs to a specific size. This class encapsulates the image-specific\n",
    "    preprocessing.\n",
    "  * **Inherits from**: `keras.layers.Layer`.\n",
    "* **AudioConveter**: `keras_hub.layers.AudioConveter`.\n",
    "  * **What it does**: Converts raw audio to model ready input.\n",
    "  * **Why it's important**: Audio models often need to preprocess raw audio input before\n",
    "    passing it to a model, e.g. by computing a spectrogram of the audio signal. This class\n",
    "    encapsulates the image specific preprocessing in an easy to use layer.\n",
    "  * **Inherits from**: `keras.layers.Layer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the classes listed here have a `from_preset()` constructor, which will instantiate\n",
    "the component with weights and state for the given pre-trained model identifier. E.g.\n",
    "`keras_hub.tokenizers.Tokenizer.from_preset(\"gemma2_2b_en\")` will create a layer that\n",
    "tokenizes text using a Gemma2 tokenizer vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
