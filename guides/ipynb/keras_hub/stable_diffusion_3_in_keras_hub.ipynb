    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into how latent diffusion models work, let's start by generating\n",
    "some images using KerasHub's APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid reinitializing variables for different tasks, we'll instantiate and\n",
    "load the trained `backbone` and `preprocessor` using KerasHub's `from_preset`\n",
    "factory method. If you only want to perform one task at a time, you can use a\n",
    "simpler API like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text_to_image = keras_hub.models.StableDiffusion3TextToImage.from_preset(\n",
    "    \"stable_diffusion_3_medium\", dtype=\"float16\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That will automatically load and configure trained `backbone` and `preprocessor`\n",
    "for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this guide, we'll use `image_shape=(512, 512, 3)` for faster\n",
    "image generation. For higher-quality output, it's recommended to use the default\n",
    "size of `1024`. Since the entire backbone has about 3 billion parameters, which\n",
    "can be challenging to fit into a consumer-level GPU, we set `dtype=\"float16\"` to\n",
    "reduce the usage of GPU memory -- the officially released weights are also in\n",
    "float16.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that the preset \"stable_diffusion_3_medium\" excludes the\n",
    "T5XXL text encoder, as it requires significantly more GPU memory. The performace\n",
    "degradation is negligible in most cases. The weights, including T5XXL, will be\n",
