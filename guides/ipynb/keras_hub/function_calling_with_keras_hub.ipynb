    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling is a powerful new feature in modern large language models that allows them to use external tools, such as Python functions, to answer questions and perform actions. Instead of just generating text, a tool-calling model can generate code that calls a function you've provided, allowing it to interact with the real world, access live data, and perform complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll walk you through a simple example of tool calling with the Gemma 3 and Mistral models and Keras Hub. We'll show you how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Define a tool (a Python function).\n",
    "2.  Tell the models about the tool.\n",
    "3.  Use the model to generate code that calls the tool.\n",
    "4.  Execute the code and feed the result back to the model.\n",
    "5.  Get a final, natural-language response from the model.\n",

    "Tool calling is a powerful feature that allows large language models to interact with the real world, access live data, and perform complex calculations. By defining a set of tools and telling the model about them, you can create sophisticated applications that go far beyond simple text generation."
