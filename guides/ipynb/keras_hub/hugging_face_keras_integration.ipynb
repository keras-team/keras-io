    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "KerasHub has built-in converters for HuggingFace's `.safetensors` models.\n",
    "Loading model weights from HuggingFace is therefore no more difficult than\n",
    "using KerasHub's own presets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KerasHub built-in HuggingFace transformers converters\n",
    "\n",
    "KerasHub simplifies the use of HuggingFace Transformers models through its\n",
    "built-in converters. These converters automatically handle the process of translating\n",
    "HuggingFace model checkpoints into a format that's compatible with the Keras ecosystem.\n",
    "This means you can seamlessly load a wide variety of pretrained models from the HuggingFace\n",
    "Hub directly into KerasHub with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key advantages of using KerasHub converters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: Load HuggingFace models without manual conversion steps.\n",
    "- **Broad Compatibility**: Access a vast range of models available on the HuggingFace Hub.\n",
    "- **Seamless Integration**: Work with these models using familiar Keras APIs for training,\n",
    "evaluation, and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, all of this happens behind the scenes, so you can focus on using\n",
    "the models rather than managing the conversion process!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed.\n",
    "You'll primarily need `keras` and `keras_hub`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Changing the backend after Keras has been imported might not work as expected.\n",
    "Ensure `KERAS_BACKEND` is set at the beginning of your script. Similarly, when working\n",
    "outside of colab, you might use `os.environ[\"HF_TOKEN\"] = \"<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>\"` to authenticate\n",
    "to HuggingFace. Set your `HF_TOKEN` as \"Colab secret\", when working with\n",
    "Google Colab."
