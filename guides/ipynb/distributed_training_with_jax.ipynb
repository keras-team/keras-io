    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generally two ways to distribute computation across multiple devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data parallelism**, where a single model gets replicated on multiple devices or\n",
    "multiple machines. Each of them processes different batches of data, then they merge\n",
    "their results. There exist many variants of this setup, that differ in how the different\n",
    "model replicas merge results, in whether they stay in sync at every batch or whether they\n",
    "are more loosely coupled, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model parallelism**, where different parts of a single model run on different devices,\n",
    "processing a single batch of data together. This works best with models that have a\n",
    "naturally-parallel architecture, such as models that feature multiple branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on data parallelism, in particular **synchronous data parallelism**,\n",
    "where the different replicas of the model stay in sync after each batch they process.\n",
    "Synchronicity keeps the model convergence behavior identical to what you would see for\n",
    "single-device training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this guide teaches you how to use `jax.sharding` APIs to train Keras\n",
    "models, with minimal changes to your code, on multiple GPUs or TPUS (typically 2 to 16)\n",
    "installed on a single machine (single host, multi-device training). This is the\n",
    "most common setup for researchers and small-scale industry workflows."
