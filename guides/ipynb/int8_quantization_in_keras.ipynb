    "## What is INT8 quantization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization lowers the numerical precision of weights and activations to reduce memory use\n",
    "and often speed up inference, at the cost of a small accuracy drop. Moving from `float32` to\n",
    "`float16` halves the memory requirements; `float32` to INT8 is ~4x smaller (and ~2x vs\n",
    "`float16`). On hardware with low-precision kernels (e.g., NVIDIA Tensor Cores), this can also\n",
    "improve throughput and latency. Actual gains depend on your backend and device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization maps real values to 8-bit integers with a scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integer domain: `[-128, 127]` (256 levels).\n",
    "* For a tensor (often per-output-channel for weights) with values `w`:\n",
    "  * Compute `a_max = max(abs(w))`.\n",
    "  * Set scale `s = (2 * a_max) / 256`.\n",
    "  * Quantize: `q = clip(round(w / s), -128, 127)` (stored as INT8) and keep `s`.\n",
    "* Inference uses `q` and `s` to reconstruct effective weights on the fly\n",
    "  (`w ≈ s · q`) or folds `s` into the matmul/conv for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory / bandwidth bound models: When implementation spends most of its time on memory I/O,\n",
    "  reducing the computation time does not reduce their overall runtime. INT8 reduces bytes\n",
    "  moved by ~4x vs `float32`, improving cache behavior and reducing memory stalls;\n",
    "  this often helps more than increasing raw FLOPs.\n",
    "* Compute bound layers on supported hardware: On NVIDIA GPUs, INT8\n",
    "  [Tensor Cores](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/) speed up matmul/conv,\n",
    "  boosting throughput on compute-limited layers.\n",
    "* Accuracy: Many models retain near-FP accuracy with `float16`; INT8 may introduce a modest\n",
    "  drop (often ~1-5% depending on task/model/data). Always validate on your own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Keras does in INT8 mode\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mapping**: Symmetric, linear quantization with INT8 plus a floating-point scale.\n",
    "* **Weights**: per-output-channel scales to preserve accuracy.\n",
    "* **Activations**: **dynamic AbsMax** scaling computed at runtime.\n",
    "* **Graph rewrite**: Quantization is applied after weights are trained and built; the graph\n",
    "  is rewritten so you can run or save immediately."

    "* Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a one-time operation; you cannot train a model\n",

    "* Always materialize weights before quantization (e.g., `build()` or a forward pass).\n",
