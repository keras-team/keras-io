# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Keras

## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a powerful technique used to align machine learning models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), with human preferences and intentions. Standard supervised fine-tuning can teach a model a specific task, but it often fails to capture the nuances of desired behavior, such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and truthfulness. RLHF addresses this by incorporating human feedback directly into the training process, guiding the model towards behaviors that humans find more desirable.

This guide demonstrates a simplified implementation of the RLHF loop using Keras and KerasNLP. We'll focus on a toy problem: training a model to generate sequences of numbers that sum to a specific target value. This will illustrate the core components and flow of RLHF without the complexity of training large-scale language models.

## Goal of this Guide

The primary goal is to provide a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of a basic RLHF pipeline, including:
1.  Setting up the policy and value models.
2.  Simulating a reward model based on predefined criteria (our "human feedback").
3.  Implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for policy updates.
4.  Observing the policy model learn to achieve the desired outcome.

## Setup

We begin by importing the necessary libraries. We'll use Keras for building our neural network models, NumPy for numerical operations, and TensorFlow as the backend.

## Core RLHF Concepts

The RLHF process involves three key components:

1.  **Policy Model**: This is the model we aim to train. In the context of LLMs, it's the language model itself. In our example, it's a simple neural network that generates sequences of numbers. The policy model learns by interacting with the environment (or by generating responses) and receiving feedback via the reward model.

2.  **Reward Model (RM)**: The reward model is trained to predict human preferences. It takes an output from the policy model (e.g., a generated piece of text or, in our case, a sequence of numbers) and assigns a scalar reward score. This score indicates how "good" the output is according to the preferences it learned from human evaluators. In a full RLHF setup, the RM is typically a separate model trained on a dataset of human-ranked responses. For this guide, we simulate the RM with a Python function that implements a predefined preference (sequences summing to a target value).

3.  **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (PPO)**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm used to update the policy model based on the rewards from the reward model. PPO is chosen for its stability and efficiency in training. It encourages the policy to explore actions that lead to higher rewards while penalizing large deviations from its previous behavior, preventing training instability.

## Model Implementation

### Policy Model

Let's define a simple Keras Sequential model to act as our policy. This model will take a dummy input (representing a context or prompt, though unused in this simple example) and output a sequence of numbers. The output layer uses a Softmax activation to produce a probability distribution over the possible numbers (our vocabulary) for each position in the sequence.

```python
~guides/rlhf_with_keras.py:54:68
```

### Value Model (Critic)

PPO often uses a "critic" model alongside the policy model (the "actor"). The critic, also known as the value model, estimates the value function `V(s)`. The value function predicts the expected cumulative future reward from a given state. This helps in calculating "advantages" – how much better an action is compared to the average action at that state. We define a simple value model, similar in structure to our policy model, but outputting a single scalar value.

```python
~guides/rlhf_with_keras.py:137:145
```

We'll also set up optimizers for both models and define some PPO hyperparameters.

```python
~guides/rlhf_with_keras.py:148:155
```

## Simulating Human Feedback (Reward Function)

In a real-world RLHF scenario, building a reliable reward model is a significant undertaking. It involves collecting a dataset where humans compare and rank different model outputs. This dataset is then used to train the reward model to predict these human judgments.

For our toy problem, we bypass this by creating a simple Python function, `get_reward_for_actions`, that directly calculates a reward based on how close the sum of a generated sequence of numbers is to a `TARGET_SUM`. This function simulates the human feedback mechanism.

```python
~guides/rlhf_with_keras.py:92:103
```

## The RLHF Training Loop

The core RLHF training process iteratively refines the policy model:

1.  **Generate Data**: The current policy model generates a batch of outputs (sequences of numbers). Crucially, instead of deterministically picking the actions with the highest probability (argmax), we *sample* actions from the policy's output distribution. This sampling encourages exploration, which is vital for the RL algorithm to discover better strategies.
2.  **Collect Feedback**: The generated outputs (the sampled action sequences) are evaluated by our simulated reward function (`get_reward_for_actions`) to obtain a scalar reward for each output.
3.  **Calculate Advantages**: Advantages are calculated using the rewards and the value estimates from the value model. A common way to calculate advantage is `A_t = R_t - V(s_t)`, where `R_t` is the observed reward and `V(s_t)` is the value function's estimate of the expected reward from state `s_t`. Advantages are often normalized to stabilize training.
4.  **Update Policy (PPO)**: The policy model (and the value model) is updated using the PPO algorithm. PPO aims to maximize the expected advantage while ensuring that the updated policy does not stray too far from the previous policy. This is achieved by clipping the objective function, which limits the change in the probability ratio between the new and old policies. The update is typically performed for several epochs over the same batch of generated data.

Here's the Keras implementation of a single RLHF training step incorporating these ideas:

```python
~guides/rlhf_with_keras.py:170:316
```

Key aspects of this `rlhf_training_step` function:
-   `old_policy_probs_numpy`: Stores the policy's output probabilities before the PPO updates begin. These are used for calculating the "old" log-probabilities in the PPO ratio.
-   Action Sampling: `tf.random.categorical` is used to sample actions, promoting exploration.
-   Reward Calculation: `get_reward_for_actions(chosen_actions)` calculates rewards based on the actions actually taken.
-   Advantage Calculation: `advantages = rewards - values_numpy`, followed by normalization.
-   PPO Update Loop:
    -   Log-probabilities of the chosen actions are calculated for both the current (updating) policy and the old policy. `tf.gather_nd` is essential here to pick the probabilities corresponding to the specific actions that were sampled.
    -   The probability ratio `r_t(θ) = exp(log π_θ(a_t|s_t) - log π_θ_old(a_t|s_t))` is computed.
    -   The PPO clipped surrogate objective is calculated: `policy_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(tf.minimum(surr1, surr2))`.
    -   The value model is updated by minimizing the mean squared error between observed rewards and its predictions.
    -   Gradients are applied to both the policy and value models.

## Running the Demo

With all components in place, we can run the RLHF training loop. We'll execute a number of iterations and periodically print the policy loss, value loss, mean reward, and some sample sequences generated by the policy. This allows us to observe the learning process.

```python
~guides/rlhf_with_keras.py:324:370
```
When you run the script, you should observe the mean reward gradually increasing as the policy learns to generate sequences that sum closer to the `TARGET_SUM`. Initially, the policy might generate random sequences with low rewards. Over iterations, the PPO updates guide the policy towards better sequences, eventually converging to sequences that consistently achieve the target sum and a reward of 1.0.

## Conclusion

This guide provided a simplified but functional walkthrough of the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) process using Keras. We demonstrated how to set up a policy model and a value model, simulate human feedback with a reward function, and use a PPO-like algorithm to train the policy model to achieve a specific goal.

Key takeaways:
-   RLHF aligns models with desired behaviors by incorporating feedback into an RL framework.
-   The core components are the policy model, the reward model, and an RL algorithm (like PPO).
-   Sampling actions for exploration and calculating rewards based on those sampled actions are crucial for effective learning.
-   Even simple Keras models can demonstrate the fundamental principles of RLHF.

For real-world applications, especially with LLMs, the complexity increases significantly. This includes training sophisticated reward models on large human preference datasets, scaling up policy and value models, and employing more advanced PPO implementations with features like Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) and entropy bonuses for better exploration and stability.

Further reading on RLHF and related techniques would involve exploring the original papers on InstructGPT, PPO, and applications of RLHF in various domains.
