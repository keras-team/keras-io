# webpack CLI

The official CLI of webpack

## About

webpack CLI provides a flexible set of commands for developers to increase speed when setting up a custom webpack project. As of webpack v4, webpack is not expecting a configuration file, but often developers want to create a more custom webpack configuration based on their use-cases and needs. webpack CLI addresses these needs by providing a set of tools to improve the setup of custom webpack configuration.

## How to install

When you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack then webpack CLI is already installed!

Otherwise

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli
```

or

```bash
yarn add webpack-cli --dev
```

## Supported arguments and commands

### Usage

All interactions with webpack-cli are of the form

```bash
npx webpack-cli [command] [options]
```

If no command is specified then `bundle` command is used by default

### Help Usage

To display basic commands and arguments -

```bash
npx webpack-cli --help
```
