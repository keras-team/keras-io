    "- Train the model on the entire dataset instead of a single month of data.\n",
    "- Train the model for more epochs and use early stopping to ensure that the\n",

    "- Make the feed-forward network more powerful by increasing the number of layers\n",
    "    while ensuring that the model is regularized.\n",
    "- Compute additional preprocessing features. For example, in addition to\n",
    "    aggregating transactions by terminal, aggregate transactions by client.\n",
    "- Use the Keras Tuner to perform hyperparameter tuning on the model. Note that\n",
    "    the parameters of the preprocessing (e.g., the number of days of\n",
    "    aggregations) are also hyperparameters that can be tuned."
