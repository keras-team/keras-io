Description: This notebook demonstrates how to do timeseries classification using a Transformer model.
Accelerator: GPU
"""

"""
## Introduction

This is the Transformer architecture from
[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762),
applied to timeseries instead of natural language.

This example requires TensorFlow 2.4 or higher.

## Load the dataset

We are going to use the same dataset and preprocessing as the
[TimeSeries Classification from Scratch](https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_classification_from_scratch)
example.

"""
## Build the model

Our model processes a tensor of shape `(batch size, sequence length, features)`,
where `sequence length` is the number of time steps and `features` is each input
timeseries.

You can replace your classification RNN layers with this one: the
inputs are fully compatible!

We include residual connections, layer normalization, and dropout.
The resulting layer can be stacked multiple times.

The projection layers are implemented through `keras.layers.Conv1D`.

    # Attention and Normalization
    x = layers.MultiHeadAttention(
        key_dim=head_size, num_heads=num_heads, dropout=dropout
    )(inputs, inputs)
    x = layers.Dropout(dropout)(x)
    res = x + inputs
    x = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(res) 

    # Feed Forward Part
    ffn_input = x
    x = layers.Conv1D(filters=ff_dim, kernel_size=1, activation="relu")(ffn_input)

    x = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(res)
    return x


"""
The main part of our model is now complete. We can stack multiple of those
`transformer_encoder` blocks and we can also proceed to add the final
Multi-Layer Perceptron classification head. Apart from a stack of `Dense`
layers, we need to reduce the output tensor of the `TransformerEncoder` part of
our model down to a vector of features for each data point in the current
batch. A common way to achieve this is to use a pooling layer. For
this example, a `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer is sufficient.

## Conclusions

In about 110-120 epochs (25s each on Colab), the model reaches a training
accuracy of ~0.95, validation accuracy of ~84 and a testing
accuracy of ~85, without hyperparameter tuning. And that is for a model
with less than 100k parameters. Of course, parameter count and accuracy could be
improved by a hyperparameter search and a more sophisticated learning rate
schedule, or a different optimizer.
