"""

"""
In this example, we develop a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE).
VQ-VAE was proposed in
[Neural Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937)
by van der Oord et al. In standard VAEs, the latent space is continuous and is sampled
from a Gaussian distribution. It is generally harder to learn such a continuous
distribution via gradient descent. VQ-VAEs, on the other hand,
operate on a discrete latent space, making the optimization problem simpler. It does so
by maintaining a discrete *codebook*. The codebook is developed by
discretizing the distance between continuous embeddings and the encoded
outputs. These discrete code words are then fed to the decoder, which is trained
to generate reconstructed samples.

For an overview of VQ-VAEs, please refer to the original paper and
[this video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZFVUrYcig0).
If you need a refresher on VAEs, you can refer to
[this book chapter](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition/chapter-12/).
VQ-VAEs are one of the main recipes behind [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)
and the idea of a codebook is used in [VQ-GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841).
This example uses implementation details from the
[official VQ-VAE tutorial](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet/blob/master/sonnet/examples/vqvae_example.ipynb)
from DeepMind. 

## Requirements

To run this example, you will need TensorFlow 2.5 or higher, as well as
TensorFlow Probability, which can be installed using the command below.

## `VectorQuantizer` layer

First, we implement a custom layer for the vector quantizer, which is the layer in between
the encoder and decoder. Consider an output from the encoder, with shape `(batch_size, height, width,
num_filters)`. The vector quantizer will first flatten this output, only keeping the
`num_filters` dimension intact. So, the shape would become `(batch_size * height * width,
num_filters)`. The rationale behind this is to treat the total number of filters as the size for
the latent embeddings.

An embedding table is then initialized to learn a codebook. We measure the L2-normalized
distance between the flattened encoder outputs and code words of this codebook. We take the
code that yields the minimum distance, and we apply one-hot encoding to achieve quantization.
This way, the code yielding the minimum distance to the corresponding encoder output is
mapped as one and the remaining codes are mapped as zeros.

Since the quantization process is not differentiable, we apply a
[straight-through estimator](https://www.hassanaskary.com/python/pytorch/deep%20learning/2020/09/19/intuitive-explanation-of-straight-through-estimators.html)
in between the decoder and the encoder, so that the decoder gradients are directly propagated
to the encoder. As the encoder and decoder share the same channel space, the decoder gradients are
still meaningful to the encoder.

"""
**A note on straight-through estimation**:

This line of code does the straight-through estimation part: `quantized = x +
tf.stop_gradient(quantized - x)`. The straight-through estimator affects the
forward computation and backpropagation differently.

During forward computation the x values cancel out and the nearest embedding `quantized`
is passed to the decoder.

During backpropagation, the `tf.stop_gradient` operator prevents the contribution
of its inputs from being taken into account. As a result, `(quantized - x)` won't be
included in the computation graph and the gradients obtained for `quantized`
will be copied for `inputs`. Thanks to [this video](https://youtu.be/VZFVUrYcig0?t=1393)
for helping me understand this technique.

## Encoder and decoder

Now for the encoder and the decoder for the VQ-VAE. We will keep them small so
that their capacity is a good fit for the MNIST dataset. The implementation of the encoder and
decoder come from
[this example](https://keras.io/examples/generative/vae).

Note that activations _other than ReLU_ may not work for the encoder and decoder layers in the
quantization architecture: Leaky ReLU activated layers, for example, have proven difficult to
train, resulting in intermittent loss spikes that the model has trouble recovering from.

The figure above shows that the discrete codes have been able to capture some
regularities from the dataset. Now, how do we sample from this codebook to create
novel images? Since these codes are discrete and we imposed a categorical distribution
on them, we cannot use them yet to generate anything meaningful until we can generate likely
sequences of codes that we can give to the decoder. 

The authors use a PixelCNN to train these codes so that they can be used as powerful priors to
generate novel examples. PixelCNN was proposed in
[Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328)
by van der Oord et al. We borrow the implementation from
[this PixelCNN example](https://keras.io/examples/generative/pixelcnn/). It's an autoregressive
generative model where the outputs are conditional on the prior ones. In other words, a PixelCNN
generates an image on a pixel-by-pixel basis. For the purpose in this example, however, its task
is to generate code book indices instead of pixels directly. The trained VQ-VAE decoder is used
to map the indices generated by the PixelCNN back into the pixel space.

## PixelCNN hyperparameters

"""
This input shape represents the reduction in the resolution performed by the encoder. With "same" padding,
this exactly halves the "resolution" of the output shape for each stride-2 convolution layer. So, with these
two layers, we end up with an encoder output tensor of 7x7 on axes 2 and 3, with the first axis as the batch
size and the last axis being the code book embedding size. Since the quantization layer in the autoencoder
maps these 7x7 tensors to indices of the code book, these output layer axis sizes must be matched by the
PixelCNN as the input shape. The task of the PixelCNN for this architecture is to generate _likely_ 7x7
arrangements of codebook indices.

Note that this shape is something to optimize for in larger-sized image domains, along with the code
book sizes. Since the PixelCNN is autoregressive, it needs to pass over each codebook index sequentially
in order to generate novel images from the codebook. Each stride-2 (or rather more correctly a 
stride (2, 2)) convolution layer will divide the image generation time by four. Note, however, that there
is probably a lower bound on this part: when the number of codes for the image to reconstruct is too small,
it has insufficient information for the decoder to represent the level of detail in the image, so the
output quality will suffer. This can be amended at least to some extent by using a larger code book. 
Since the autoregressive part of the image generation procedure uses codebook indices, there is far less of 
a performance penalty on using a larger code book as the lookup time for a larger-sized code from a larger
code book is much smaller in comparison to iterating over a larger sequence of code book indices, although
the size of the code book does impact on the batch size that can pass through the image generation procedure.
Finding the sweet spot for this trade-off can require some architecture tweaking and could very well differ
per dataset.
