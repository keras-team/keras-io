    "\n",
    "Generative image models learn a \"latent manifold\" of the visual world:\n",
    "a low-dimensional vector space where each point maps to an image.\n",
    "Going from such a point on the manifold back to a displayable image\n",
    "is called \"decoding\" -- in the Stable Diffusion model, this is handled by\n",
    "the \"decoder\" model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Stable Diffusion architecture](https://i.imgur.com/2uC8rYJ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This latent manifold of images is continuous and interpolative, meaning that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Moving a little on the manifold only changes the corresponding image a little (continuity).\n",
    "2. For any two points A and B on the manifold (i.e. any two images), it is possible\n",
    "to move from A to B via a path where each intermediate point is also on the manifold (i.e.\n",
    "is also a valid image). Intermediate points would be called \"interpolations\" between\n",
    "the two starting images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Diffusion isn't just an image model, though, it's also a natural language model.\n",
    "It has two latent spaces: the image representation space learned by the\n",
    "encoder used during training, and the prompt latent space\n",
    "which is learned using a combination of pretraining and training-time\n",
    "fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Latent space walking_, or _latent space exploration_, is the process of\n",
    "sampling a point in latent space and incrementally changing the latent\n",
    "representation. Its most common application is generating animations\n",
    "where each sampled point is fed to the decoder and is stored as a\n",
    "frame in the final animation.\n",
    "For high-quality latent representations, this produces coherent-looking\n",
    "animations. These animations can provide insight into the feature map of the\n",
    "latent space, and can ultimately lead to improvements in the training\n",
    "process. One such GIF is displayed below:\n",

    "in KerasCV to perform prompt interpolation and circular walks through\n",
