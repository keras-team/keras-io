## Introduction

In this tutorial, we implement the CaiT (Class-Attention in Image Transformers)
proposed in [Going deeper with Image Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239) by
Touvron et al. Depth scaling, i.e. increasing the model depth for obtaining better
performance and generalization has been quite successful for convolutional neural
networks ([Tan et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946),
[Doll√°r et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06877), for example). But applying
the same model scaling principles to
Vision Transformers ([Dosovitskiy et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)) doesn't
translate equally well -- their performance gets saturated quickly with depth scaling.
Note that one assumption here is that the underlying pre-training dataset is
always kept fixed when performing model scaling.

In the CaiT paper, the authors investigate this phenomenon and propose modifications to
the vanilla ViT (Vision Transformers) architecture to mitigate this problem.

The tutorial is structured like so:

* Implementation of the individual blocks of CaiT
* Collating all the blocks to create the CaiT model
* Loading a pre-trained CaiT model
* Obtaining prediction results
* Visualization of the different attention layers of CaiT

The readers are assumed to be familiar with Vision Transformers already. Here is
an implementation of Vision Transformers in Keras:
[Image classification with Vision Transformer](https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/).

## The LayerScale layer

We begin by implementing a **LayerScale** layer which is one of the two modifications
proposed in the CaiT paper.

When increasing the depth of the ViT models, they meet with optimization instability and
eventually don't converge. The residual connections within each Transformer block
introduce information bottleneck. When there is an increased amount of depth, this
bottleneck can quickly explode and deviate the optimization pathway for the underlying
model.

The following equations denote where residual connections are added within a Transformer
block:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jWV5bFb/image.png"/>
</div>

where, **SA** stands for self-attention, **FFN** stands for feed-forward network, and
**eta** denotes the LayerNorm operator ([Ba et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450)).

LayerScale is formally implemented like so:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/VYDWNn9/image.png"/>
</div>

where, the lambdas are learnable parameters and are initialized with a very small value
({0.1, 1e-5, 1e-6}). **diag** represents a diagonal matrix.

Intuitively, LayerScale helps control the contribution of the residual branches. The
learnable parameters of LayerScale are initialized to a small value to let the branches
act like identity functions and then let them figure out the degrees of interactions
during the training. The diagonal matrix additionally helps control the contributions
of the individual dimensions of the residual inputs as it is applied on a per-channel
basis.

The practical implementation of LayerScale is simpler than it might sound.

"""
## Class attention

The vanilla ViT uses self-attention (SA) layers for modelling how the image patches and
the _learnable_ CLS token interact with each other. The CaiT authors propose to decouple
the attention layers responsible for attending to the image patches and the CLS tokens.

When using ViTs for any discriminative tasks (classification, for example), we usually
take the representations belonging to the CLS token and then pass them to the
task-specific heads. This is as opposed to using something like global average pooling as
is typically done in convolutional neural networks.

The interactions between the CLS token and other image patches are processed uniformly
through self-attention layers. As the CaiT authors point out, this setup has got an
entangled effect. On one hand, the self-attention layers are responsible for modelling
the image patches. On the other hand, they're also responsible for summarizing the
modelled information via the CLS token so that it's useful for the learning objective.

To help disentangle these two things, the authors propose to:

* Introduce the CLS token at a later stage in the network.
* Model the interaction between the CLS token and the representations related to the
image patches through a separate set of attention layers. The authors call this **Class
Attention** (CA).

The figure below (taken from the original paper) depicts this idea:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cxeooHr.png"/ width=350>
</div>

This is achieved by treating the CLS token embeddings as the queries in the CA layers.
CLS token embeddings and the image patch embeddings are fed as keys as well values.

**Note** that "embeddings" and "representations" have been used interchangeably here.

## Conclusion

In this notebook, we implemented the CaiT model. It shows how to mitigate the issues in

the additional visualizations provided in the notebook spark excitement in the community
