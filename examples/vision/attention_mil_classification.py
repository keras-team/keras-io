## Introduction

### What is Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)?

Usually, with supervised learning algorithms, the learner receives labels for a set of
instances. In the case of MIL, the learner receives labels for a set of bags, each of which
contains a set of instances. The bag is labeled positive if it contains at least
one positive instance, and negative if it does not contain any.

### Motivation

It is often assumed in image classification tasks that each image clearly represents a
class label. In medical imaging (e.g. computational pathology, etc.) an *entire image*
is represented by a single class label (cancerous/non-cancerous) or a region of interest
could be given. However, one will be interested in knowing which patterns in the image
is actually causing it to belong to that class. In this context, the image(s) will be
divided and the subimages will form the bag of instances.

Therefore, the goals are to:

1. Learn a model to predict a class label for a bag of instances.
2. Find out which instances within the bag caused a position class label
prediction.

### Implementation

The following steps describe how the model works:

1. The feature extractor layers extract feature embeddings.
2. The embeddings are fed into the MIL attention layer to get
the attention scores. The layer is designed as permutation-invariant.
3. Input features and their corresponding attention scores are multiplied together.
4. The resulting output is passed to a softmax function for classification.

## Create dataset

We will create a set of bags and assign their labels according to their contents.
If at least one positive instance
is available in a bag, the bag is considered as a positive bag. If it does not contain any
positive instance, the bag will be considered as negative.

### Configuration parameters

- `POSITIVE_CLASS`: The desired class to be kept in the positive bag.
- `BAG_COUNT`: The number of training bags.
- `VAL_BAG_COUNT`: The number of validation bags.
- `BAG_SIZE`: The number of instances in a bag.
- `PLOT_SIZE`: The number of bags to plot.
- `ENSEMBLE_AVG_COUNT`: The number of models to create and average together. (Optional:
often results in better performance - set to 1 for single model)

positive class label is randomly placed among the instances in the positive bag.

"""
## Create the model

We will now build the attention layer, prepare some utilities, then build and train the
entire model.

### Attention operator implementation

The output size of this layer is decided by the size of a single bag.

The attention mechanism uses a weighted average of instances in a bag, in which the sum
of the weights must equal to 1 (invariant of the bag size).

The weight matrices (parameters) are **w** and **v**. To include positive and negative
values, hyperbolic tangent element-wise non-linearity is utilized.

A **Gated attention mechanism** can be used to deal with complex relations. Another weight
matrix, **u**, is added to the computation.
A sigmoid non-linearity is used to overcome approximately linear behavior for *x* ∈ [−1, 1]
by hyperbolic tangent non-linearity.

## Conclusion

From the above plot, you can notice that the weights always sum to 1. In a
positively predict bag, the instance which resulted in the positive labeling will have
a substantially higher attention score than the rest of the bag. However, in a negatively
predicted bag, there are two cases:

* All instances will have approximately similar scores.
* An instance will have relatively higher score (but not as high as of a positive instance).
This is because the feature space of this instance is close to that of the positive instance.

## Remarks

- If the model is overfit, the weights will be equally distributed for all bags. Hence,
the regularization techniques are necessary.
- In the paper, the bag sizes can differ from one bag to another. For simplicity, the
bag sizes are fixed here.
- In order not to rely on the random initial weights of a single model, averaging ensemble
methods should be considered.
