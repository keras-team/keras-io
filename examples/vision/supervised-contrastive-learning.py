## Introduction

[Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362)
(Prannay Khosla et al.) is a training methodology that outperforms
supervised training with crossentropy on classification tasks.

Essentially, training an image classification model with Supervised Contrastive
Learning is performed in two phases:

1. Training an encoder to learn to produce vector representations of input images such
that representations of images in the same class will be more similar compared to
representations of images in different classes.
2. Training a classifier on top of the frozen encoder.

## Experiment 2: Use supervised contrastive learning

In this experiment, the model is trained in two phases. In the first phase,
the encoder is pretrained to optimize the supervised contrastive loss,
described in [Prannay Khosla et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362).

In the second phase, the classifier is trained using the trained encoder with
its weights freezed; only the weights of fully-connected layers with the
softmax are optimized.

## Conclusion

As shown in the experiments, using the supervised contrastive learning technique
outperformed the conventional technique in terms of the test accuracy. Note that
the same training budget (i.e., number of epochs) was given to each technique.
Supervised contrastive learning pays off when the encoder involves a complex
architecture, like ResNet, and multi-class problems with many labels.
In addition, large batch sizes and multi-layer projection heads
improve its effectiveness. See the [Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362)
paper for more details.
