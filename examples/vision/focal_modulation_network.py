## Introduction

This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the implementation of
Focal Modulation Networks, as presented in
[Yang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11926).

This tutorial will provide a formal, minimalistic approach to implementing Focal
Modulation Networks and explore its potential applications in the field of Deep Learning.

**Problem statement**

The Transformer architecture ([Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)),
which has become the de facto standard in most Natural Language Processing tasks, has
also been applied to the field of computer vision, e.g. Vision
Transformers ([Dosovitskiy et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929v2)).

> In Transformers, the self-attention (SA) is arguably the key to its success which
enables input-dependent global interactions, in contrast to convolution operation which
constraints interactions in a local region with a shared kernel.

The **Attention** module is mathematically written as shown in **Equation 1**.

| ![Attention Equation](https://i.imgur.com/thdHvQx.png) |
| :--: |
| Equation 1: The mathematical equation of attention (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

Where:

- `Q` is the query
- `K` is the key
- `V` is the value
- `d_k` is the dimension of the key

With **self-attention**, the query, key, and value are all sourced from the input
sequence. Let us rewrite the attention equation for self-attention as shown in **Equation
2**.

| ![Self-Attention Equation](https://i.imgur.com/OFsmVdP.png) |
| :--: |
| Equation 2: The mathematical equation of self-attention (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

Upon looking at the equation of self-attention, we see that it is a quadratic equation.
Therefore, as the number of tokens increase, so does the computation time (cost too). To
mitigate this problem and make Transformers more interpretable, Yang et al.
have tried to replace the Self-Attention module with better components.

**The Solution**

Yang et al. introduce the Focal Modulation layer to serve as a
seamless replacement for the Self-Attention Layer. The layer boasts high
interpretability, making it a valuable tool for Deep Learning practitioners.

In this tutorial, we will delve into the practical application of this layer by training
the entire model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and visually interpreting the layer's
performance.

Note: We try to align our implementation with the
[official implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/FocalNet).

## Architecture

We pause here to take a quick look at the Architecture of the Focal Modulation Network.
**Figure 1** shows how every individual layer is compiled into a single model. This gives
us a bird's eye view of the entire architecture.

| Figure 1: A diagram of the Focal Modulation model (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

We dive deep into each of these layers in the following sections. This is the order we
will follow:


- Patch Embedding Layer
- Focal Modulation Block
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron
  - Focal Modulation Layer
    - Hierarchical Contextualization
    - Gated Aggregation
  - Building Focal Modulation Block
- Building the Basic Layer

To better understand the architecture in a format we are well versed in, let us see how
the Focal Modulation Network would look when drawn like a Transformer architecture.

**Figure 2** shows the encoder layer of a traditional Transformer architecture where Self
Attention is replaced with the Focal Modulation layer.

The <font color="blue">blue</font> blocks represent the Focal Modulation block. A stack
of these blocks builds a single Basic Layer. The <font color="green">green</font> blocks
represent the Focal Modulation layer.

### Focal Modulation layer

In a typical Transformer architecture, for each visual token (**query**) `x_i in R^C` in
an input feature map `X in R^{HxWxC}` a **generic encoding process** produces a feature
representation `y_i in R^C`.

The encoding process consists of **interaction** (with its surroundings for e.g. a dot
product), and **aggregation** (over the contexts for e.g weighted mean).

We will talk about two types of encoding here:
- Interaction and then Aggregation in **Self-Attention**
- Aggregation and then Interaction in **Focal Modulation**

**Self-Attention**

| ![Self-Attention Expression](https://i.imgur.com/heBYp0F.png) |

| **Figure 4**: Self-Attention module. (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

| ![Aggregation and Interaction for Self-Attention](https://i.imgur.com/j1k8Xmy.png) |
| :--: |
| **Equation 3:** Aggregation and Interaction in Self-Attention(Surce: Aritra and Ritwik)|

As shown in **Figure 4** the query and the key interact (in the interaction step) with
each other to output the attention scores. The weighted aggregation of the value comes
next, known as the aggregation step.

**Focal Modulation**

| ![Focal Modulation module](https://i.imgur.com/tmbLgQl.png) |

| ![Aggregation and Interaction in Focal Modulation](https://i.imgur.com/gsvJfWp.png) |
| :--: |
| **Equation 4:** Aggregation and Interaction in Focal Modulation (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

**Figure 5** depicts the Focal Modulation layer. `q()` is the query projection
function. It is a **linear layer** that projects the query into a latent space. `m ()` is
the context aggregation function. Unlike self-attention, the
aggregation step takes place in focal modulation before the interaction step.
"""

"""
While `q()` is pretty straightforward to understand, the context aggregation function
`m()` is more complex. Therefore, this section will focus on `m()`.

| ![Context Aggregation](https://i.imgur.com/uqIRXI7.png)|

The context aggregation function `m()` consists of two parts as shown in **Figure 6**:
- Hierarchical Contextualization
- Gated Aggregation
"""

"""
#### Hierarchical Contextualization

| ![Hierarchical Contextualization](https://i.imgur.com/q875c83.png)|
| :--: |
| **Figure 7**: Hierarchical Contextualization (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

In **Figure 7**, we see that the input is first projected linearly. This linear projection
produces `Z^0`. Where `Z^0` can be expressed as follows:

| ![Linear projection of z_not](https://i.imgur.com/pd0Z2Of.png) |
| :--: |
| Equation 5: Linear projection of `Z^0` (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

`Z^0` is then passed on to a series of Depth-Wise (DWConv) Conv and
[GeLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/gelu) layers. The
authors term each block of DWConv and GeLU as levels denoted by `l`. In **Figure 6** we
have two levels. Mathematically this is represented as:

| ![Levels of modulation](https://i.imgur.com/ijGD1Df.png) |
| :--: |
| Equation 6: Levels of the modulation layer (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

where `l in {1, ... , L}`

The final feature map goes through a Global Average Pooling Layer. This can be expressed
as follows:

| Equation 7: Average Pooling of the final feature (Source: Aritra and Ritwik)|
"""

"""
#### Gated Aggregation

| ![Gated Aggregation](https://i.imgur.com/LwrdDKo.png[/img)|
| :--: |
| **Figure 8**: Gated Aggregation (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

Now that we have `L+1` intermediate feature maps by virtue of the Hierarchical
Contextualization step, we need a gating mechanism that lets some features pass and
prohibits others. This can be implemented with the attention module.
Later in the tutorial, we will visualize these gates to better understand their
usefulness.

First, we build the weights for aggregation. Here we apply a **linear layer** on the input
feature map that projects it into `L+1` dimensions.

| ![Gates](https://i.imgur.com/1CgEo1G.png) |
| :--: |
| Eqation 8: Gates (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

Next we perform the weighted aggregation over the contexts.

| ![z out](https://i.imgur.com/mpJ712R.png) |
| :--: |
| Eqation 9: Final feature map (Source: Aritra and Ritwik) |

to obtain the modulator

"""
### Visualization Callback

A key feature of the Focal Modulation Network is explicit input-dependency. This means
the modulator is calculated by looking at the local features around the target location,
so it depends on the input. In very simple terms, this makes interpretation easy. We can
simply lay down the gating values and the original image, next to each other to see how
the gating mechanism works.

The authors of the paper visualize the gates and the modulator in order to focus on the
interpretability of the Focal Modulation layer. Below is a visualization
callback that shows the gates and modulator of a specific layer in the model while the
model trains.

We will notice later that as the model trains, the visualizations get better.

The gates appear to selectively permit certain aspects of the input image to pass
through, while gently disregarding others, ultimately leading to improved classification
accuracy.

## Conclusion

The proposed architecture, the Focal Modulation Network
architecture is a mechanism that allows different
parts of an image to interact with each other in a way that depends on the image itself.
It works by first gathering different levels of context information around each part of
the image (the "query token"), then using a gate to decide which context information is
most relevant, and finally combining the chosen information in a simple but effective
way.

This is meant as a replacement of Self-Attention mechanism from the Transformer
architecture. The key feature that makes this research notable is not the conception of
attention-less networks, but rather the introduction of a equally powerful architecture
that is interpretable.

The authors also mention that they created a series of Focal Modulation Networks
(FocalNets) that significantly outperform Self-Attention counterparts and with a fraction
of parameters and pretraining data.

The FocalNets architecture has the potential to deliver impressive results and offers a
simple implementation. Its promising performance and ease of use make it an attractive
alternative to Self-Attention for researchers to explore in their own projects. It could
potentially become widely adopted by the Deep Learning community in the near future.
