## Introduction

Object detection a very important problem in computer
vision. Here the model is tasked with localizing the objects present in an
image, and at the same time, classifying them into different categories.
Object detection models can be broadly classified into "single-stage" and
"two-stage" detectors. Two-stage detectors are often more accurate but at the
cost of being slower. Here in this example, we will implement RetinaNet,
a popular single-stage detector, which is accurate and runs fast.
RetinaNet uses a feature pyramid network to efficiently detect objects at
multiple scales and introduces a new loss, the Focal loss function, to alleviate
the problem of the extreme foreground-background class imbalance.

## Downloading the COCO2017 dataset

Training on the entire COCO2017 dataset which has around 118k images takes a
lot of time, hence we will be using a smaller subset of ~500 images for
training in this example.


```python
url = "https://github.com/srihari-humbarwadi/datasets/releases/download/v0.1.0/data.zip"
filename = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data.zip")
keras.utils.get_file(filename, url)


with zipfile.ZipFile("data.zip", "r") as z_fp:
    z_fp.extractall("./")

```

## Implementing utility functions

Bounding boxes can be represented in multiple ways, the most common formats are:

- Storing the coordinates of the corners `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`
- Storing the coordinates of the center and the box dimensions
`[x, y, width, height]`

Since we require both formats, we will be implementing functions for converting
between the formats.


```python

def swap_xy(boxes):
    """Swaps order the of x and y coordinates of the boxes.

    Arguments:
      boxes: A tensor with shape `(num_boxes, 4)` representing bounding boxes.

    Returns:
      swapped boxes with shape same as that of boxes.
    """
    return tf.stack([boxes[:, 1], boxes[:, 0], boxes[:, 3], boxes[:, 2]], axis=-1)


def convert_to_xywh(boxes):
    """Changes the box format to center, width and height.

    Arguments:
      boxes: A tensor of rank 2 or higher with a shape of `(..., num_boxes, 4)`
        representing bounding boxes where each box is of the format
        `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`.

    Returns:
      converted boxes with shape same as that of boxes.
    """
    return tf.concat(
        [(boxes[..., :2] + boxes[..., 2:]) / 2.0, boxes[..., 2:] - boxes[..., :2]],
        axis=-1,
    )


def convert_to_corners(boxes):
    """Changes the box format to corner coordinates

    Arguments:
      boxes: A tensor of rank 2 or higher with a shape of `(..., num_boxes, 4)`
        representing bounding boxes where each box is of the format
        `[x, y, width, height]`.

    Returns:
      converted boxes with shape same as that of boxes.
    """
    return tf.concat(
        [boxes[..., :2] - boxes[..., 2:] / 2.0, boxes[..., :2] + boxes[..., 2:] / 2.0],
        axis=-1,
    )

```

## Computing pairwise Intersection Over Union (IOU)

As we will see later in the example, we would be assigning ground truth boxes
to anchor boxes based on the extent of overlapping. This will require us to
calculate the Intersection Over Union (IOU) between all the anchor
boxes and ground truth boxes pairs.


```python

def compute_iou(boxes1, boxes2):
    """Computes pairwise IOU matrix for given two sets of boxes

    Arguments:
      boxes1: A tensor with shape `(N, 4)` representing bounding boxes
        where each box is of the format `[x, y, width, height]`.
        boxes2: A tensor with shape `(M, 4)` representing bounding boxes
        where each box is of the format `[x, y, width, height]`.

    Returns:
      pairwise IOU matrix with shape `(N, M)`, where the value at ith row
        jth column holds the IOU between ith box and jth box from
        boxes1 and boxes2 respectively.
    """
    boxes1_corners = convert_to_corners(boxes1)
    boxes2_corners = convert_to_corners(boxes2)
    lu = tf.maximum(boxes1_corners[:, None, :2], boxes2_corners[:, :2])
    rd = tf.minimum(boxes1_corners[:, None, 2:], boxes2_corners[:, 2:])
    intersection = tf.maximum(0.0, rd - lu)
    intersection_area = intersection[:, :, 0] * intersection[:, :, 1]
    boxes1_area = boxes1[:, 2] * boxes1[:, 3]
    boxes2_area = boxes2[:, 2] * boxes2[:, 3]
    union_area = tf.maximum(
        boxes1_area[:, None] + boxes2_area - intersection_area, 1e-8
    )
    return tf.clip_by_value(intersection_area / union_area, 0.0, 1.0)

    image = np.array(image, dtype=np.uint8)
    plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.imshow(image)
    ax = plt.gca()
    for box, _cls, score in zip(boxes, classes, scores):
        text = "{}: {:.2f}".format(_cls, score)

## Implementing Anchor generator

Anchor boxes are fixed sized boxes that the model uses to predict the bounding
box for an object. It does this by regressing the offset between the location
of the object's center and the center of an anchor box, and then uses the width
and height of the anchor box to predict a relative scale of the object. In the
case of RetinaNet, each location on a given feature map has nine anchor boxes
(at three scales and three ratios).


```python

class AnchorBox:
    """Generates anchor boxes.

    This class has operations to generate anchor boxes for feature maps at
    strides `[8, 16, 32, 64, 128]`. Where each anchor each box is of the
    format `[x, y, width, height]`.

    Attributes:
      aspect_ratios: A list of float values representing the aspect ratios of
        the anchor boxes at each location on the feature map

## Preprocessing data

Preprocessing the images involves two steps:

- Resizing the image: Images are resized such that the shortest size is equal
to 800 px, after resizing if the longest side of the image exceeds 1333 px,
the image is resized such that the longest size is now capped at 1333 px.
- Applying augmentation: Random scale jittering  and random horizontal flipping
are the only augmentations applied to the images.

Along with the images, bounding boxes are rescaled and flipped if required.


```python

def random_flip_horizontal(image, boxes):
    """Flips image and boxes horizontally with 50% chance

    Arguments:
      image: A 3-D tensor of shape `(height, width, channels)` representing an
        image.

## Encoding labels

The raw labels, consisting of bounding boxes and class ids need to be
transformed into targets for training. This transformation consists of
the following steps:

- Generating anchor boxes for the given image dimensions
- Assigning ground truth boxes to the anchor boxes
- The anchor boxes that are not assigned any objects, are either assigned the
background class or ignored depending on the IOU
- Generating the classification and regression targets using anchor boxes


```python

## Building the ResNet50 backbone

RetinaNet uses a ResNet based backbone, using which a feature pyramid network
is constructed. In the example we use ResNet50 as the backbone, and return the
feature maps at strides 8, 16 and 32.

## Setting up a `tf.data` pipeline

To ensure that the model is fed with data efficiently we will be using
`tf.data` API to create our input pipeline. The input pipeline
consists for the following major processing steps:

- Apply the preprocessing function to the samples
- Create batches with fixed batch size. Since images in the batch can
have different dimensions, and can also have different number of
objects, we use `padded_batch` to the add the necessary padding to create
rectangular tensors
- Create targets for each sample in the batch using `LabelEncoder`


```python
autotune = tf.data.AUTOTUNE
train_dataset = train_dataset.map(preprocess_data, num_parallel_calls=autotune)
train_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(8 * batch_size)
train_dataset = train_dataset.padded_batch(
    batch_size=batch_size, padding_values=(0.0, 1e-8, -1), drop_remainder=True
)
train_dataset = train_dataset.map(
    label_encoder.encode_batch, num_parallel_calls=autotune
)
train_dataset = train_dataset.apply(tf.data.experimental.ignore_errors())
train_dataset = train_dataset.prefetch(autotune)

val_dataset = val_dataset.map(preprocess_data, num_parallel_calls=autotune)
val_dataset = val_dataset.padded_batch(
    batch_size=1, padding_values=(0.0, 1e-8, -1), drop_remainder=True
)
val_dataset = val_dataset.map(label_encoder.encode_batch, num_parallel_calls=autotune)
val_dataset = val_dataset.apply(tf.data.experimental.ignore_errors())
val_dataset = val_dataset.prefetch(autotune)
