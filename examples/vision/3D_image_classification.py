## Introduction

This example will show the steps needed to build a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)
to predict the presence of viral pneumonia in computer tomography (CT) scans. 2D CNNs are
commonly used to process RGB images (3 channels). A 3D CNN is simply the 3D
equivalent: it takes as input a 3D volume or a sequence of 2D frames (e.g. slices in a CT scan),
3D CNNs are a powerful model for learning representations for volumetric data.

## Downloading the MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings

In this example, we use a subset of the
[MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20100362v1).
This dataset consists of lung CT scans with COVID-19 related findings, as well as without such findings.

We will be using the associated radiological findings of the CT scans as labels to build
a classifier to predict presence of viral pneumonia.
Hence, the task is a binary classification problem.

## Loading data and preprocessing

The files are provided in Nifti format with the extension .nii. To read the
scans, we use the `nibabel` package.
You can install the package via `pip install nibabel`. CT scans store raw voxel
intensity in Hounsfield units (HU). They range from -1024 to above 2000 in this dataset.
Above 400 are bones with different radiointensity, so this is used as a higher bound. A threshold
between -1000 and 400 is commonly used to normalize CT scans.

To process the data, we do the following:

* We first rotate the volumes by 90 degrees, so the orientation is fixed
* We scale the HU values to be between 0 and 1.
* We resize width, height and depth.

Here we define several helper functions to process the data. These functions
will be used when building training and validation datasets.

## Data augmentation

The CT scans also augmented by rotating at random angles during training. Since
the data is stored in rank-3 tensors of shape `(samples, height, width, depth)`,
we add a dimension of size 1 at axis 4 to be able to perform 3D convolutions on
the data. The new shape is thus `(samples, height, width, depth, 1)`. There are
different kinds of preprocessing and augmentation techniques out there,
this example shows a few simple ones to get started.
