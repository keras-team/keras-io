Description: Implementing the MLP-Mixer, FNet, and gMLP models for CIFAR-100 image classification.
Accelerator: GPU
"""

"""
## Introduction

This example implements three modern attention-free, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based models for image
classification, demonstrated on the CIFAR-100 dataset:

1. The [MLP-Mixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601) model, by Ilya Tolstikhin et al., based on two types of MLPs.
3. The [FNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03824) model, by James Lee-Thorp et al., based on unparameterized
Fourier Transform.
2. The [gMLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08050) model, by Hanxiao Liu et al., based on MLP with gating.

The purpose of the example is not to compare between these models, as they might perform differently on
different datasets with well-tuned hyperparameters. Rather, it is to show simple implementations of their
main building blocks.

## The MLP-Mixer model

The MLP-Mixer is an architecture based exclusively on
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), that contains two types of MLP layers:

1. One applied independently to image patches, which mixes the per-location features.
2. The other applied across patches (along channels), which mixes spatial information.

This is similar to a [depthwise separable convolution based model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)
such as the Xception model, but with two chained dense transforms, no max pooling, and layer normalization
instead of batch normalization.

The MLP-Mixer model tends to have much less number of parameters compared

when pre-trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes,
the MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores to state-of-the-art models.
