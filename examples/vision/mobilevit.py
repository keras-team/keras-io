Description: MobileViT for image classification with combined benefits of convolutions and Transformers.
Accelerator: GPU
"""

"""
## Introduction

In this example, we implement the MobileViT architecture
([Mehta et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02178)),
which combines the benefits of Transformers
([Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762))
and convolutions. With Transformers, we can capture long-range dependencies that result
in global representations. With convolutions, we can capture spatial relationships that
model locality.

Besides combining the properties of Transformers and convolutions, the authors introduce
MobileViT as a general-purpose mobile-friendly backbone for different image recognition
tasks. Their findings suggest that, performance-wise, MobileViT is better than other
models with the same or higher complexity ([MobileNetV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244),
for example), while being efficient on mobile devices.

Note: This example should be run with Tensorflow 2.13 and higher.

## MobileViT utilities

The MobileViT architecture is comprised of the following blocks:

* Strided 3x3 convolutions that process the input image.
* [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)-style inverted residual blocks for
downsampling the resolution of the intermediate feature maps.
* MobileViT blocks that combine the benefits of Transformers and convolutions. It is
presented in the figure below (taken from the
[original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02178)):

**More on the MobileViT block**:

* First, the feature representations (A) go through convolution blocks that capture local
relationships. The expected shape of a single entry here would be `(h, w, num_channels)`.
* Then they get unfolded into another vector with shape `(p, n, num_channels)`,
where `p` is the area of a small patch, and `n` is `(h * w) / p`. So, we end up with `n`
non-overlapping patches.
* This unfolded vector is then passed through a Tranformer block that captures global
relationships between the patches.
* The output vector (B) is again folded into a vector of shape `(h, w, num_channels)`
resembling a feature map coming out of convolutions.

Vectors A and B are then passed through two more convolutional layers to fuse the local
and global representations. Notice how the spatial resolution of the final vector remains
unchanged at this point. The authors also present an explanation of how the MobileViT
block resembles a convolution block of a CNN. For more details, please refer to the
original paper.
