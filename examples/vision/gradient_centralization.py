## Introduction

This example implements [Gradient Centralization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01461), a
new optimization technique for Deep Neural Networks by Yong et al., and demonstrates it
on Laurence Moroney's [Horses or Humans
Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/horses_or_humans). Gradient
Centralization can both speedup training process and improve the final generalization
performance of DNNs. It operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient
vectors to have zero mean. Gradient Centralization morever improves the Lipschitzness of
the loss function and its gradient so that the training process becomes more efficient
and stable.

This example requires `tensorflow_datasets` which can be installed with this command:

```
pip install tensorflow-datasets
```

## Implement Gradient Centralization

We will now
subclass the `RMSProp` optimizer class modifying the
`keras.optimizers.Optimizer.get_gradients()` method where we now implement Gradient
Centralization. On a high level the idea is that let us say we obtain our gradients
through back propagation for a Dense or Convolution layer we then compute the mean of the
column vectors of the weight matrix, and then remove the mean from each column vector.

The experiments in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01461) on various
applications, including general image classification, fine-grained image classification,
detection and segmentation and Person ReID demonstrate that GC can consistently improve
the performance of DNN learning.

Also, for simplicity at the moment we are not implementing gradient cliiping functionality,
however this quite easy to implement.

At the moment we are just creating a subclass for the `RMSProp` optimizer
however you could easily reproduce this for any other optimizer or on a custom
optimizer in the same way. We will be using this class in the later section when
we train a model with Gradient Centralization.

Readers are encouraged to try out Gradient Centralization on different datasets from
different domains and experiment with it's effect. You are strongly advised to check out
the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01461) as well - the authors present
several studies on Gradient Centralization showing how it can improve general
performance, generalization, training time as well as more efficient.
