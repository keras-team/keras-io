    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, with supervised learning algorithms, the learner receives labels for a set of\n",
    "instances. In the case of MIL, the learner receives labels for a set of bags, each of which\n",
    "contains a set of instances. The bag is labeled positive if it contains at least\n",
    "one positive instance, and negative if it does not contain any.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often assumed in image classification tasks that each image clearly represents a\n",
    "class label. In medical imaging (e.g. computational pathology, etc.) an *entire image*\n",
    "is represented by a single class label (cancerous/non-cancerous) or a region of interest\n",
    "could be given. However, one will be interested in knowing which patterns in the image\n",
    "is actually causing it to belong to that class. In this context, the image(s) will be\n",
    "divided and the subimages will form the bag of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the goals are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn a model to predict a class label for a bag of instances.\n",
    "2. Find out which instances within the bag caused a position class label\n",
    "prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps describe how the model works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The feature extractor layers extract feature embeddings.\n",
    "2. The embeddings are fed into the MIL attention layer to get\n",
    "the attention scores. The layer is designed as permutation-invariant.\n",
    "3. Input features and their corresponding attention scores are multiplied together.\n",
    "4. The resulting output is passed to a softmax function for classification.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "From the above plot, you can notice that the weights always sum to 1. In a\n",
    "positively predict bag, the instance which resulted in the positive labeling will have\n",
    "a substantially higher attention score than the rest of the bag. However, in a negatively\n",
    "predicted bag, there are two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All instances will have approximately similar scores.\n",
    "* An instance will have relatively higher score (but not as high as of a positive instance).\n",
    "This is because the feature space of this instance is close to that of the positive instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the model is overfit, the weights will be equally distributed for all bags. Hence,\n",
    "the regularization techniques are necessary.\n",
    "- In the paper, the bag sizes can differ from one bag to another. For simplicity, the\n",
    "bag sizes are fixed here.\n",
    "- In order not to rely on the random initial weights of a single model, averaging ensemble\n",
    "methods should be considered."
