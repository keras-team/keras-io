    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example explores how to use the Forward-Forward algorithm to perform\n",
    "training instead of the traditionally-used method of backpropagation, as proposed by\n",
    "Hinton in\n",
    "[The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigations](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/FFA13.pdf)\n",
    "(2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept was inspired by the understanding behind\n",
    "[Boltzmann Machines](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/dbm.pdf). Backpropagation\n",
    "involves calculating the difference between actual and predicted output via a cost\n",
    "function to adjust network weights. On the other hand, the FF Algorithm suggests the\n",
    "analogy of neurons which get \"excited\" based on looking at a certain recognized\n",
    "combination of an image and its correct corresponding label.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes certain inspiration from the biological learning process that occurs in\n",
    "the cortex. A significant advantage that this method brings is the fact that\n",
    "backpropagation through the network does not need to be performed anymore, and that\n",
    "weight updates are local to the layer itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is yet still an experimental method, it does not yield state-of-the-art results.\n",
    "But with proper tuning, it is supposed to come close to the same.\n",
    "Through this example, we will examine a process that allows us to implement the\n",
    "Forward-Forward algorithm within the layers themselves, instead of the traditional method\n",
    "of relying on the global loss functions and optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform necessary imports\n",
    "- Load the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)\n",
    "- Visualize Random samples from the MNIST dataset\n",
    "- Define a `FFDense` Layer to override `call` and implement a custom `forwardforward`\n",
    "method which performs weight updates.\n",
    "- Define a `FFNetwork` Layer to override `train_step`, `predict` and implement 2 custom\n",
    "functions for per-sample prediction and overlaying labels\n",
    "- Convert MNIST from `NumPy` arrays to `tf.data.Dataset`\n",
    "- Fit the network\n",
    "- Visualize results\n",
    "- Perform inference on test samples\n",
    "\n",
    "As this example requires the customization of certain core functions with\n",
    "`keras.layers.Layer` and `keras.models.Model`, refer to the following resources for\n",
    "a primer on how to do so:\n",
    "\n",
