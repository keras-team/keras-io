    "## Introduction: what is EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",
    "EfficientNet, first introduced in [Tan and Le, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)\n",
    "is among the most efficient models (i.e. requiring least FLOPS for inference)\n",
    "that reaches State-of-the-Art accuracy on both\n",
    "imagenet and common image classification transfer learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest base model is similar to [MnasNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11626), which\n",
    "reached near-SOTA with a significantly smaller model. By introducing a heuristic way to\n",
    "scale the model, EfficientNet provides a family of models (B0 to B7) that represents a\n",
    "good combination of efficiency and accuracy on a variety of scales. Such a scaling\n",
    "heuristics (compound-scaling, details see\n",
    "[Tan and Le, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)) allows the\n",
    "efficiency-oriented base model (B0) to surpass models at every scale, while avoiding\n",
    "extensive grid-search of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary of the latest updates on the model is available at\n",
    "[here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet), where various\n",
    "augmentation schemes and semi-supervised learning approaches are applied to further\n",
    "improve the imagenet performance of the models. These extensions of the model can be used\n",
    "by updating weights without changing model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B0 to B7 variants of EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",
    "*(This section provides some details on \"compound scaling\", and can be skipped\n",
    "if you're only interested in using the models)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) people may have the\n",
    "impression that EfficientNet is a continuous family of models created by arbitrarily\n",
    "choosing scaling factor in as Eq.(3) of the paper.  However, choice of resolution,\n",
    "depth and width are also restricted by many factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resolution: Resolutions not divisible by 8, 16, etc. cause zero-padding near boundaries\n",
    "of some layers which wastes computational resources. This especially applies to smaller\n",
    "variants of the model, hence the input resolution for B0 and B1 are chosen as 224 and\n",
    "240.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depth and width: The building blocks of EfficientNet demands channel size to be\n",
    "multiples of 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource limit: Memory limitation may bottleneck resolution when depth\n",
    "and width can still increase. In such a situation, increasing depth and/or\n",
    "width but keep resolution can still improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the depth, width and resolution of each variant of the EfficientNet models\n",
    "are hand-picked and proven to produce good results, though they may be significantly\n",
    "off from the compound scaling formula.\n",
    "Therefore, the keras implementation (detailed below) only provide these 8 models, B0 to B7,\n",
    "instead of allowing arbitray choice of width / depth / resolution parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keras implementation of EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of EfficientNet B0 to B7 has been shipped with tf.keras since TF2.3. To\n",
    "use EfficientNetB0 for classifying 1000 classes of images from imagenet, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0\n",
    "model = EfficientNetB0(weights='imagenet')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This model takes input images of shape (224, 224, 3), and the input data should range\n",
    "[0, 255]. Normalization is included as part of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because training EfficientNet on ImageNet takes a tremendous amount of resources and\n",
    "several techniques that are not a part of the model architecture itself. Hence the Keras\n",
    "implementation by default loads pre-trained weights obtained via training with\n",
    "[AutoAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501).\n",
    "\n",
    "For B0 to B7 base models, the input shapes are different. Here is a list of input shape\n",
    "expected for each model:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Base model | resolution|\n",
    "|----------------|-----|\n",
    "| EfficientNetB0 | 224 |\n",
    "| EfficientNetB1 | 240 |\n",
    "| EfficientNetB2 | 260 |\n",
    "| EfficientNetB3 | 300 |\n",
    "| EfficientNetB4 | 380 |\n",
    "| EfficientNetB5 | 456 |\n",
    "| EfficientNetB6 | 528 |\n",
    "| EfficientNetB7 | 600 |\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is intended for transfer learning, the Keras implementation\n",
    "provides a option to remove the top layers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "model = EfficientNetB0(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')\n",
    "```\n",
    "This option excludes the final `Dense` layer that turns 1280 features on the penultimate\n",
    "layer into prediction of the 1000 ImageNet classes. Replacing the top layer with custom\n",
    "layers allows using EfficientNet as a feature extractor in a transfer learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another argument in the model constructor worth noticing is `drop_connect_rate` which controls\n",
    "the dropout rate responsible for [stochastic depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382).\n",
    "This parameter serves as a toggle for extra regularization in finetuning, but does not\n",
    "affect loaded weights. For example, when stronger regularization is desired, try:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = EfficientNetB0(weights='imagenet', drop_connect_rate=0.4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The default value is 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: EfficientNetB0 for Stanford Dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "EfficientNet is capable of a wide range of image classification tasks.\n",
    "This makes it a good model for transfer learning.\n",
    "As an end-to-end example, we will show using pre-trained EfficientNetB0 on\n",
    "[Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/main.html) dataset."

    "### Tips for fine tuning EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",
    "On unfreezing layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `BathcNormalization` layers need to be kept frozen\n",
    "([more details](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/)).\n",
    "If they are also turned to trainable, the\n",
    "first epoch after unfreezing will significantly reduce accuracy.\n",
    "- In some cases it may be beneficial to open up only a portion of layers instead of\n",
    "unfreezing all. This will make fine tuning much faster when going to larger models like\n",
    "B7.\n",
    "- Each block needs to be all turned on or off. This is because the architecture includes\n",
    "a shortcut from the first layer to the last layer for each block. Not respecting blocks\n",
    "also significantly harms the final performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other tips for utilizing EfficientNet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Larger variants of EfficientNet do not guarantee improved performance, especially for\n",
    "tasks with less data or fewer classes. In such a case, the larger variant of EfficientNet\n",
    "chosen, the harder it is to tune hyperparameters.\n",
    "- EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is very helpful in training EfficientNet from scratch,\n",
    "but not so much for transfer learning.\n",
    "- Do not use the RMSprop setup as in the original paper for transfer learning. The\n",
    "momentum and learning rate are too high for transfer learning. It will easily corrupt the\n",
    "pretrained weight and blow up the loss. A quick check is to see if loss (as categorical\n",
    "cross entropy) is getting significantly larger than log(NUM_CLASSES) after the same\n",
    "epoch. If so, the initial learning rate/momentum is too high.\n",
    "- Smaller batch size benefit validation accuracy, possibly due to effectively providing\n",
    "regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the latest EfficientNet weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the initial paper, the EfficientNet has been improved by various methods for data\n",
    "preprocessing and for using unlabelled data to enhance learning results. These\n",
    "improvements are relatively hard and computationally costly to reproduce, and require\n",
    "extra code; but the weights are readily available in the form of TF checkpoint files. The\n",
    "model architecture has not changed, so loading the improved checkpoints is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a checkpoint provided at\n",
    "[the official model repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet), first\n",
    "download the checkpoint. As example, here we download noisy-student version of B1:\n",

    "!tar -xf noisy_student_efficientnet-b1.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use the script [efficientnet_weight_update_util.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/applications/efficientnet_weight_update_util.py) to convert ckpt file to h5 file.\n",
