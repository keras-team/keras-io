    "\n",
    "Knowledge Distillation is a procedure for model\n",
    "compression, in which a small (student) model is trained to match a large pre-trained\n",
    "(teacher) model. Knowledge is transferred from the teacher model to the student\n",
    "by minimizing a loss function, aimed at matching softened teacher logits as well as\n",
    "ground-truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logits are softened by applying a \"temperature\" scaling function in the softmax,\n",
    "effectively smoothing out the probability distribution and revealing\n",
    "inter-class relationships learned by the teacher.\n",
