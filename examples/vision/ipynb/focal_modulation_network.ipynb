    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed architecture, the Focal Modulation Network\n",
    "architecture is a mechanism that allows different\n",
    "parts of an image to interact with each other in a way that depends on the image itself.\n",
    "It works by first gathering different levels of context information around each part of\n",
    "the image (the \"query token\"), then using a gate to decide which context information is\n",
    "most relevant, and finally combining the chosen information in a simple but effective\n",
    "way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is meant as a replacement of Self-Attention mechanism from the Transformer\n",
    "architecture. The key feature that makes this research notable is not the conception of\n",
    "attention-less networks, but rather the introduction of a equally powerful architecture\n",
    "that is interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors also mention that they created a series of Focal Modulation Networks\n",
    "(FocalNets) that significantly outperform Self-Attention counterparts and with a fraction\n",
    "of parameters and pretraining data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FocalNets architecture has the potential to deliver impressive results and offers a\n",
    "simple implementation. Its promising performance and ease of use make it an attractive\n",
    "alternative to Self-Attention for researchers to explore in their own projects. It could\n",
    "potentially become widely adopted by the Deep Learning community in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
