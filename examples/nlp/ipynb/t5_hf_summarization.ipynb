    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic summarization is one of the central problems in\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP). It poses several challenges relating to language\n",
    "understanding (e.g. identifying important content)\n",
    "and generation (e.g. aggregating and rewording the identified content into a summary).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we tackle the single-document summarization task\n",
    "with an abstractive modeling approach. The primary idea here is to generate a short,\n",
    "single-sentence news summary answering the question “What is the news article about?”.\n",
    "This approach to summarization is also known as *Abstractive Summarization* and has\n",
    "seen growing interest among researchers in various disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following prior work, we aim to tackle this problem using a\n",
    "sequence-to-sequence model. [Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (`T5`)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)\n",
    "is a [Transformer-based](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model built on the encoder-decoder\n",
    "architecture, pretrained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks where each task\n",
    "is converted into a text-to-text format. T5 shows impressive results in a variety of sequence-to-sequence\n",
    "(sequence in this notebook refers to text) like summarization, translation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will fine-tune the pretrained T5 on the Abstractive Summarization\n",
    "task using Hugging Face Transformers on the `XSum` dataset loaded from Hugging Face Datasets."
