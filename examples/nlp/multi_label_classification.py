"""
## Introduction

In this example, we will build a multi-label text classifier to predict the subject areas
of arXiv papers from their abstract bodies. This type of classifier can be useful for
conference submission portals like [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/). Given a paper
abstract, the portal could provide suggestions for which areas the paper would
best belong to.

The dataset was collected using the
[`arXiv` Python library](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py)
that provides a wrapper around the
[original arXiv API](http://arxiv.org/help/api/index).
To learn more about the data collection process, please refer to
[this notebook](https://github.com/soumik12345/multi-label-text-classification/blob/master/arxiv_scrape.ipynb).
Additionally, you can also find the dataset on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/spsayakpaul/arxiv-paper-abstracts).

## Use stratified splits because of class imbalance

The dataset has a
[class imbalance problem](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#class-imbalanced-dataset).

stratification. To know more about different strategies to deal with the class imbalance
problem, you can follow
[this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/imbalanced_data).

## Vectorization

Before we feed the data to our model, we need to vectorize it (represent it in a numerical form).
For that purpose, we will use the
[`TextVectorization` layer](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/text/text_vectorization).
It can operate as a part of your main model so that the model is excluded from the core
preprocessing logic. This greatly reduces the chances of training / serving skew during inference.

We first calculate the number of unique words present in the abstracts.

"""
A batch of raw text will first go through the `TextVectorization` layer and it will
generate their integer representations. Internally, the `TextVectorization` layer will
first create bi-grams out of the sequences and then represent them using
[TF-IDF](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). The output representations will then
be passed to the shallow model responsible for text classification.

To learn more about other possible configurations with `TextVectorizer`, please consult
the
[official documentation](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/text/text_vectorization).

**Note**: Setting the `max_tokens` argument to a pre-calculated vocabulary size is
not a requirement.

We will keep our model simple -- it will be a small stack of fully-connected layers with
ReLU as the non-linearity.

    )

"""
## Train the model

We will train our model using the binary crossentropy loss. This is because the labels
are not disjoint. For a given abstract, we may have multiple categories. So, we will
divide the prediction task into a series of multiple binary classification problems. This
is also why we kept the activation function of the classification layer in our model to
sigmoid. Researchers have used other combinations of loss function and activation
function as well. For example, in [Exploring the Limits of Weakly Supervised Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00932),
Mahajan et al. used the softmax activation function and cross-entropy loss to train
their models.

There are several options of metrics that can be used in multi-label classification.
To keep this code example narrow we decided to use the
[binary accuracy metric](https://keras.io/api/metrics/accuracy_metrics/#binaryaccuracy-class).
To see the explanation why this metric is used we refer to this
[pull-request](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/pull/1133#issuecomment-1322736860).
There are also other suitable metrics for multi-label classification, like
[F1 Score](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/metrics/F1Score) or
[Hamming loss](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/metrics/HammingLoss).

"""
## Inference

An important feature of the
[preprocessing layers provided by Keras](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/)
is that they can be included inside a `tf.keras.Model`. We will export an inference model
by including the `text_vectorization` layer on top of `shallow_mlp_model`. This will
allow our inference model to directly operate on raw strings.

**Note** that during training it is always preferable to use these preprocessing
layers as a part of the data input pipeline rather than the model to avoid
surfacing bottlenecks for the hardware accelerators. This also allows for
asynchronous data processing.
