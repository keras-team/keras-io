## Introduction

In this example, we will demonstrate the ability of FNet to achieve comparable
results with a vanilla Transformer model on the text classification task.
We will be using the IMDb dataset, which is a
collection of movie reviews labelled either positive or negative (sentiment
analysis).

To build the tokenizer, model, etc., we will use components from
[KerasHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub). KerasHub makes life easier
for people who want to build NLP pipelines! :)

### Model

Transformer-based language models (LMs) such as BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, etc. have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the self-attention mechanism for computing
rich embeddings for input text. However, the self-attention mechanism is an
expensive operation, with a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number
of tokens in the input. Hence, there has been an effort to reduce the time
complexity of the self-attention mechanism and improve performance without
sacrificing the quality of results.

In 2020, a paper titled
[FNet: Mixing Tokens with Fourier Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03824)
replaced the self-attention layer in BERT with a simple Fourier Transform layer
for "token mixing". This resulted in comparable accuracy and a speed-up during
training. In particular, a couple of points from the paper stand out:

* The authors claim that FNet is 80% faster than BERT on GPUs and 70% faster on
TPUs. The reason for this speed-up is two-fold: a) the Fourier Transform layer
is unparametrized, it does not have any parameters, and b) the authors use Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT); this reduces the time complexity from `O(n^2)`
(in the case of self-attention) to `O(n log n)`.
* FNet manages to achieve 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT on the GLUE benchmark.

Before we start with the implementation, let's import all the necessary packages.

"""
Let's also define our hyperparameters.

"""
## Loading the dataset

First, let's download the IMDB dataset and extract it.
"""

"""shell

"""
Samples are present in the form of text files. Let's inspect the structure of
the directory.

folder since it has unlabelled samples.
"""

"""shell
rm -rf aclImdb/train/unsup

We'll use the `keras.utils.text_dataset_from_directory` utility to generate
our labelled `tf.data.Dataset` dataset from text files.

"""
### Tokenizing the data

We'll be using the `keras_hub.tokenizers.WordPieceTokenizer` layer to tokenize
the text. `keras_hub.tokenizers.WordPieceTokenizer` takes a WordPiece vocabulary
and has functions for tokenizing the text, and detokenizing sequences of tokens.

Before we define the tokenizer, we first need to train it on the dataset
we have. The WordPiece tokenization algorithm is a subword tokenization algorithm;
training it on a corpus gives us a vocabulary of subwords. A subword tokenizer
is a compromise between word tokenizers (word tokenizers need very large
vocabularies for good coverage of input words), and character tokenizers
(characters don't really encode meaning like words do). Luckily, KerasHub
makes it very simple to train WordPiece on a corpus with the
`keras_hub.tokenizers.compute_word_piece_vocabulary` utility.

Note: The official implementation of FNet uses the SentencePiece Tokenizer.

        word_piece_ds.batch(1000).prefetch(2),
        vocabulary_size=vocab_size,
        reserved_tokens=reserved_tokens,
    )
    return vocab


"""
Every vocabulary has a few special, reserved tokens. We have two such tokens:

- `"[PAD]"` - Padding token. Padding tokens are appended to the input sequence length
when the input sequence length is shorter than the maximum sequence length.
- `"[UNK]"` - Unknown token.
"""
reserved_tokens = ["[PAD]", "[UNK]"]

vocab = train_word_piece(train_ds, VOCAB_SIZE, reserved_tokens)

"""

"""
print("Tokens: ", vocab[100:110])

"""
Now, let's define the tokenizer. We will configure the tokenizer with the
the vocabularies trained above. We will define a maximum sequence length so that
all sequences are padded to the same length, if the length of the sequence is
less than the specified sequence length. Otherwise, the sequence is truncated.
"""

    sequence_length=MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH,

been tokenized correctly, we can also detokenize the list of tokens back to the
original text.

need to tokenize the text.

"""
## Building the model

Now, let's move on to the exciting part - defining our model!
We first need an embedding layer, i.e., a layer that maps every token in the input
sequence to a vector. This embedding layer can be initialised randomly. We also
need a positional embedding layer which encodes the word order in the sequence.
The convention is to add, i.e., sum, these two embeddings. KerasHub has a
`keras_hub.layers.TokenAndPositionEmbedding ` layer which does all of the above
steps for us.

Our FNet classification model consists of three `keras_hub.layers.FNetEncoder`
layers with a `keras.layers.Dense` layer on top.

Note: For FNet, masking the padding tokens has a minimal effect on results. In the
official implementation, the padding tokens are not masked.
