## Introduction

In this example, we will build and train a model for predicting multimodal entailment. We will be
using the
[multimodal entailment dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/recognizing-multimodal-entailment)
recently introduced by Google Research.

### What is multimodal entailment?

On social media platforms, to audit and moderate content
we may want to find answers to the
following questions in near real-time:

* Does a given piece of information contradict the other?
* Does a given piece of information imply the other?

In NLP, this task is called analyzing _textual entailment_. However, that's only
when the information comes from text content.
In practice, it's often the case the information available comes not just
from text content, but from a multimodal combination of text, images, audio, video, etc.
_Multimodal entailment_ is simply the extension of textual entailment to a variety
of new input modalities.

### Requirements

This example requires TensorFlow 2.5 or higher. In addition, TensorFlow Hub and
TensorFlow Text are required for the BERT model
([Devlin et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)). These libraries can be installed
using the following command:

## Model building utilities

Our final model will accept two images along with their text counterparts. While the
images will be directly fed to the model the text inputs will first be preprocessed and
then will make it into the model. Below is a visual illustration of this approach:

![](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Multimodal-Entailment-Baseline/raw/main/figures/brief_architecture.png)

The model consists of the following elements:

* A standalone encoder for the images. We will use a
[ResNet50V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027) pre-trained on the ImageNet-1k dataset for
this.
* A standalone encoder for the images. A pre-trained BERT will be used for this.

After extracting the individual embeddings, they will be projected in an identical space.
Finally, their projections will be concatenated and be fed to the final classification
layer.

This is a multi-class classification problem involving the following classes:

* NoEntailment
* Implies
* Contradictory

## Additional notes regarding training

**Incorporating regularization**:

The training logs suggest that the model is starting to overfit and may have benefitted
from regularization. Dropout ([Srivastava et al.](https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html))
is a simple yet powerful regularization technique that we can use in our model.
But how should we apply it here?

We could always introduce Dropout (`keras.layers.Dropout`) in between different layers of the model.
But here is another recipe. Our model expects inputs from two different data modalities.
What if either of the modalities is not present during inference? To account for this,
we can introduce Dropout to the individual projections just before they get concatenated:

```python
vision_projections = keras.layers.Dropout(rate)(vision_projections)
text_projections = keras.layers.Dropout(rate)(text_projections)
concatenated = keras.layers.Concatenate()([vision_projections, text_projections])
```

**Attending to what matters**:

Do all parts of the images correspond equally to their textual counterparts? It's likely
not the case. To make our model only focus on the most important bits of the images that relate
well to their corresponding textual parts we can use "cross-attention":

```python
# Embeddings.
vision_projections = vision_encoder([image_1, image_2])
text_projections = text_encoder(text_inputs)

# Cross-attention (Luong-style).
query_value_attention_seq = keras.layers.Attention(use_scale=True, dropout=0.2)(
    [vision_projections, text_projections]
)
# Concatenate.
concatenated = keras.layers.Concatenate()([vision_projections, text_projections])
contextual = keras.layers.Concatenate()([concatenated, query_value_attention_seq])
```

To see this in action, refer to
[this notebook](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Multimodal-Entailment-Baseline/blob/main/multimodal_entailment_attn.ipynb).

**Handling class imbalance**:

The dataset suffers from class imbalance. Investigating the confusion matrix of the
above model reveals that it performs poorly on the minority classes. If we had used a
weighted loss then the training would have been more guided. You can check out
[this notebook](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Multimodal-Entailment-Baseline/blob/main/multimodal_entailment.ipynb)
that takes class-imbalance into account during model training.

**Using only text inputs**:

Also, what if we had only incorporated text inputs for the entailment task? Because of
the nature of the text inputs encountered on social media platforms, text inputs alone
would have hurt the final performance. Under a similar training setup, by only using
text inputs we get to 67.14% top-1 accuracy on the same test set. Refer to
[this notebook](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Multimodal-Entailment-Baseline/blob/main/text_entailment.ipynb)
for details.

Finally, here is a table comparing different approaches taken for the entailment task:

| Type  | Standard<br>Cross-entropy     | Loss-weighted<br>Cross-entropy    | Focal Loss    |
|:---:  |:---:  |:---:    |:---:    |
| Multimodal    | 77.86%    | 67.86%    | 86.43%    |
| Only text     | 67.14%    | 11.43%    | 37.86%    |

## Final remarks

* The architecture we used in this example is too large for the number of data points
available for training. It's going to benefit from more data.
* We used a smaller variant of the original BERT model. Chances are high that with a
larger variant, this performance will be improved. TensorFlow Hub
[provides](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/bert_glue#loading_models_from_tensorflow_hub)
a number of different BERT models that you can experiment with.
* We kept the pre-trained models frozen. Fine-tuning them on the multimodal entailment
task would could resulted in better performance.
* We built a simple baseline model for the multimodal entailment task. There are various
approaches that have been proposed to tackle the entailment problem.
