    "\n",
    "Identification of speech commands, also known as *keyword spotting* (KWS),\n",
    "is important from an engineering perspective for a wide range of applications,\n",
    "from indexing audio databases and indexing keywords, to running speech models locally\n",
    "on microcontrollers. Currently, many human-computer interfaces (HCI) like Google\n",
    "Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri and others rely on keyword\n",
    "spotting. There is a significant amount of research in the field by all major companies,\n",
    "notably Google and Baidu.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past decade, deep learning has led to significant performance\n",
    "gains on this task. Though low-level audio features extracted from raw audio like MFCC or\n",
    "mel-filterbanks have been used for decades, the design of these low-level features\n",
    "are [flawed by biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08596). Moreover, deep learning models\n",
    "trained on these low-level features can easily overfit to noise or signals irrelevant to the\n",
    "task.  This makes it is essential for any system to learn speech representations that make\n",
    "high-level information, such as acoustic and linguistic content, including phonemes,\n",
    "words, semantic meanings, tone, speaker characteristics from speech signals available to\n",
    "solve the downstream task. [Wav2Vec 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477), which solves a\n",
    "self-supervised contrastive learning task to learn high-level speech representations,\n",
    "provides a great alternative to traditional low-level features for training deep learning\n",
    "models for KWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we train the Wav2Vec 2.0 (base) model, built on the\n",
    "Hugging Face Transformers library, in an end-to-end fashion on the keyword spotting task and\n",
    "achieve state-of-the-art results on the Google Speech Commands Dataset."
