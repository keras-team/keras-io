# Keras Reinforcement Learning Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and techniques implemented using Keras.

## Examples

### RLHF Dummy Demo
-   **Description**: A simplified demonstration of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It illustrates the core components of RLHF, including a policy model, a reward model, and a training loop that simulates learning from human preferences in a basic environment.
-   **Python Script**: [`rlhf_dummy_demo.py`](rlhf_dummy_demo.py)
-   **Guide**: [`md/rlhf_dummy_demo.md`](md/rlhf_dummy_demo.md)
-   **Notes**:
    - This demo uses the JAX backend for Keras.
    - The accompanying guide explains RLHF concepts and the script's implementation details.
    - The script encountered timeout issues in some testing environments, which are discussed in the guide.
