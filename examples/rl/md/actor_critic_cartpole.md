## Introduction

This script shows an implementation of Actor Critic method on CartPole-V0 environment.

### Actor Critic Method

As an agent takes actions and moves through an environment, it learns to map
the observed state of the environment to two possible outputs:

1. Recommended action: A probability value for each action in the action space.
   The part of the agent responsible for this output is called the **actor**.
2. Estimated rewards in the future: Sum of all rewards it expects to receive in the
   future. The part of the agent responsible for this output is the **critic**.

Agent and Critic learn to perform their tasks, such that the recommended actions
from the actor maximize the rewards.

### CartPole-V0

A pole is attached to a cart placed on a frictionless track. The agent has to apply
force to move the cart. It is rewarded for every time step the pole
remains upright. The agent, therefore, must learn to keep the pole from falling over.

## Setup



```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "tensorflow"
import gym
import numpy as np
import keras
from keras import ops
from keras import layers
import tensorflow as tf

# Configuration parameters for the whole setup
seed = 42
gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor for past rewards
max_steps_per_episode = 10000
# Adding `render_mode='human'` will show the attempts of the agent
env = gym.make("CartPole-v0")  # Create the environment
env.reset(seed=seed)
eps = np.finfo(np.float32).eps.item()  # Smallest number such that 1.0 + eps != 1.0

```

## Implement Actor Critic network

This network learns two functions:

1. Actor: This takes as input the state of our environment and returns a
probability value for each action in its action space.
2. Critic: This takes as input the state of our environment and returns
an estimate of total rewards in the future.

In our implementation, they share the initial layer.



```python
num_inputs = 4
num_actions = 2
num_hidden = 128

inputs = layers.Input(shape=(num_inputs,))
common = layers.Dense(num_hidden, activation="relu")(inputs)
action = layers.Dense(num_actions, activation="softmax")(common)
critic = layers.Dense(1)(common)

model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[action, critic])

```

## Train

            # total reward = `value` in the future. We took an action with log probability
            # of `log_prob` and ended up receiving a total reward = `ret`.
            # The actor must be updated so that it predicts an action that leads to
            # high rewards (compared to critic's estimate) with high probability.
