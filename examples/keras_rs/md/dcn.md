## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Deep & Cross Networks (DCN) to effectively
learn feature crosses. Before diving into the example, let's briefly discuss
feature crosses.

Imagine that we are building a recommender system for blenders. Individual
features might include a customer's past purchase history (e.g.,
`purchased_bananas`, `purchased_cooking_books`) or geographic location. However,
a customer who has purchased both bananas and cooking books is more likely to be
interested in a blender than someone who purchased only one or the other. The
combination of `purchased_bananas` and `purchased_cooking_books` is a feature
cross. Feature crosses capture interaction information between individual
features, providing richer context than the individual features alone.

![Why are feature crosses important?](https://i.imgur.com/qDK6UZh.gif)

Learning effective feature crosses presents several challenges. In web-scale
applications, data is often categorical, resulting in high-dimensional and
sparse feature spaces.  Identifying impactful feature crosses in such
environments typically relies on manual feature engineering or computationally
expensive exhaustive searches. While traditional feed-forward multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) are universal function approximators, they often struggle to
efficiently learn even second- or third-order feature interactions.

The Deep & Cross Network (DCN) architecture is designed for more effective
learning of explicit and bounded-degree feature crosses. It comprises three main
components: an input layer (typically an embedding layer), a cross network for
modeling explicit feature interactions, and a deep network for capturing
implicit interactions.

The cross network is the core of the DCN. It explicitly performs feature
crossing at each layer, with the highest polynomial degree of feature
interaction increasing with depth. The following figure shows the `(i+1)`-th
cross layer.

The deep network is a standard feedforward multilayer perceptron
(MLP). These two networks are then combined to form the DCN.  Two common
combination strategies exist: a stacked structure, where the deep network is
placed on top of the cross network, and a parallel structure, where they
operate in parallel.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now that we know a little bit about DCN, let's start writing some code. We will
first train a DCN on a toy dataset, and demonstrate that the model has indeed
learnt important feature crosses.

Let's set the backend to JAX, and get our imports sorted.


```python
import os

os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"  # `"tensorflow"`/`"torch"`

import keras
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable

import keras_rs
```

Let's also define variables which will be reused throughout the example.


```python
TOY_CONFIG = {
    "learning_rate": 0.01,
    "num_epochs": 100,
    "batch_size": 1024,
}

MOVIELENS_CONFIG = {
    # features
    "int_features": [
        "movie_id",
        "user_id",
        "user_gender",
        "bucketized_user_age",
    ],
    "str_features": [
        "user_zip_code",
        "user_occupation_text",
    ],
    # model
    "embedding_dim": 32,
    "deep_net_num_units": [192, 192, 192],
    "projection_dim": 20,
    "dcn_num_units": [192, 192],
    # training
    "learning_rate": 0.01,
    "num_epochs": 10,
    "batch_size": 1024,
}

```

Here, we define a helper function for visualising weights of the cross layer in
order to better understand its functioning. Also, we define a function for
compiling, training and evaluating a given model.


```python

def visualize_layer(matrix, features):
    plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))

    im = plt.matshow(np.abs(matrix), cmap=plt.cm.Blues)

    ax = plt.gca()
    divider = make_axes_locatable(plt.gca())
    cax = divider.append_axes("right", size="5%", pad=0.05)
    plt.colorbar(im, cax=cax)
    cax.tick_params(labelsize=10)
    ax.set_xticklabels([""] + features, rotation=45, fontsize=10)
    ax.set_yticklabels([""] + features, fontsize=10)


def train_and_evaluate(
    learning_rate,
    epochs,
    train_data,
    test_data,
    model,
):
    optimizer = keras.optimizers.AdamW(learning_rate=learning_rate)
    loss = keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
    rmse = keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError()

    model.compile(
        optimizer=optimizer,
        loss=loss,
        metrics=[rmse],
    )

    model.fit(
        train_data,
        epochs=epochs,
        verbose=0,
    )

    results = model.evaluate(test_data, return_dict=True, verbose=0)
    rmse_value = results["root_mean_squared_error"]

    return rmse_value, model.count_params()


def print_stats(rmse_list, num_params, model_name):
    # Report metrics.
    num_trials = len(rmse_list)
    avg_rmse = np.mean(rmse_list)
    std_rmse = np.std(rmse_list)

    if num_trials == 1:
        print(f"{model_name}: RMSE = {avg_rmse}; #params = {num_params}")
    else:
        print(f"{model_name}: RMSE = {avg_rmse} ± {std_rmse}; #params = {num_params}")

```

## Toy Example

To illustrate the benefits of DCNs, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we
have a dataset for modeling the likelihood of a customer clicking on a blender
advertisement. The features and label are defined as follows:

| **Features / Label** | **Description**                | **Range**|
|:--------------------:|:------------------------------:|:--------:|
| `x1` = country       | Customer's resident country    | [0, 199] |
| `x2` = bananas       | # bananas purchased            | [0, 23]  |
| `x3` = cookbooks     | # cooking books purchased      | [0, 5]   |
| `y`                  | Blender ad click likelihood    | -        |

Then, we let the data follow the following underlying distribution:
`y = f(x1, x2, x3) = 0.1x1 + 0.4x2 + 0.7x3 + 0.1x1x2 +`
`3.1x2x3 + 0.1x3^2`.

This distribution shows that the click likelihood (`y`) depends linearly on
individual features (`xi`) and on multiplicative interactions between them. In
this scenario, the likelihood of purchasing a blender (`y`) is influenced not
only by purchasing bananas (`x2`) or cookbooks (`x3`) individually, but also
significantly by the interaction of purchasing both bananas and cookbooks
(`x2x3`).

### Preparing the dataset

Let's create synthetic data based on the above equation, and form the train-test
splits.


```python

def get_mixer_data(data_size=100_000):
    country = np.random.randint(200, size=[data_size, 1]) / 200.0
    bananas = np.random.randint(24, size=[data_size, 1]) / 24.0
    cookbooks = np.random.randint(6, size=[data_size, 1]) / 6.0

    x = np.concatenate([country, bananas, cookbooks], axis=1)

    # Create 1st-order terms.
    y = 0.1 * country + 0.4 * bananas + 0.7 * cookbooks

    # Create 2nd-order cross terms.
    y += (
        0.1 * country * bananas
        + 3.1 * bananas * cookbooks
        + (0.1 * cookbooks * cookbooks)
    )

    return x, y


x, y = get_mixer_data(data_size=100_000)
num_train = 90_000
train_x = x[:num_train]
train_y = y[:num_train]
test_x = x[num_train:]
test_y = y[num_train:]
```

### Building the model

To demonstrate the advantages of a cross network in recommender systems, we'll
compare its performance with a deep network. Since our example data only
contains second-order feature interactions, a single-layered cross network will
suffice. For datasets with higher-order interactions, multiple cross layers can
be stacked to form a multi-layered cross network. We will build two models:

1. A cross network with a single cross layer.
2. A deep network with wider and deeper feedforward layers.


```python
cross_network = keras.Sequential(
    [
        keras_rs.layers.FeatureCross(),
        keras.layers.Dense(1),
    ]
)

deep_network = keras.Sequential(
    [
        keras.layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        keras.layers.Dense(256, activation="relu"),
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
        keras.layers.Dense(1),
    ]
)
```

### Model training

Before we train the model, we need to batch our datasets.


```python
train_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_x, train_y)).batch(
    TOY_CONFIG["batch_size"]
)
test_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((test_x, test_y)).batch(
    TOY_CONFIG["batch_size"]
)
```

Let's train both models. Remember we have set `verbose=0` for brevity's
sake, so do not be alarmed if you do not see any output for a while.

After training, we evaluate the models on the unseen dataset. We will report
the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) here.

We observe that the cross network achieved significantly lower RMSE compared to
a ReLU-based DNN, while also using fewer parameters. This points to the
efficiency of the cross network in learning feature interactions.


```python
cross_network_rmse, cross_network_num_params = train_and_evaluate(
    learning_rate=TOY_CONFIG["learning_rate"],
    epochs=TOY_CONFIG["num_epochs"],
    train_data=train_ds,
    test_data=test_ds,
    model=cross_network,
)
print_stats(
    rmse_list=[cross_network_rmse],
    num_params=cross_network_num_params,
    model_name="Cross Network",
)

deep_network_rmse, deep_network_num_params = train_and_evaluate(
    learning_rate=TOY_CONFIG["learning_rate"],
    epochs=TOY_CONFIG["num_epochs"],
    train_data=train_ds,
    test_data=test_ds,
    model=deep_network,
)
print_stats(
    rmse_list=[deep_network_rmse],
    num_params=deep_network_num_params,
    model_name="Deep Network",
)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Cross Network: RMSE = 0.002540863584727049; #params = 16
Deep Network: RMSE = 0.0026898200158029795; #params = 166401
```
</div>

### Visualizing feature interactions

Since we already know which feature crosses are important in our data, it would
be interesting to verify whether our model has indeed learned these key feature
interactions. This can be done by visualizing the learned weight matrix in the
cross network, where the weight `Wij` represents the learned importance of
the interaction between features `xi` and `xj`.


```python
visualize_layer(
    matrix=cross_network.weights[0].numpy(),
    features=["country", "purchased_bananas", "purchased_cookbooks"],
)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">

## Real-world example

Let's use the MovieLens 100K dataset. This dataset is used to train models to
predict users' movie ratings, based on user-related features and movie-related
features.

### Preparing the dataset

The dataset processing steps here are similar to what's given in the
[basic ranking](/keras_rs/examples/basic_ranking/)
tutorial. Let's load the dataset, and keep only the useful columns.


```python
ratings_ds = tfds.load("movielens/100k-ratings", split="train")
ratings_ds = ratings_ds.map(
    lambda x: (
        {
            "movie_id": int(x["movie_id"]),
            "user_id": int(x["user_id"]),
            "user_gender": int(x["user_gender"]),
            "user_zip_code": x["user_zip_code"],
            "user_occupation_text": x["user_occupation_text"],
            "bucketized_user_age": int(x["bucketized_user_age"]),
        },
        x["user_rating"],  # label
    )
)
```

For every feature, let's get the list of unique values, i.e., vocabulary, so
that we can use that for the embedding layer.


```python
vocabularies = {}
for feature_name in MOVIELENS_CONFIG["int_features"] + MOVIELENS_CONFIG["str_features"]:
    vocabulary = ratings_ds.batch(10_000).map(lambda x, y: x[feature_name])
    vocabularies[feature_name] = np.unique(np.concatenate(list(vocabulary)))
```

One thing we need to do is to use `keras.layers.StringLookup` and
`keras.layers.IntegerLookup` to convert all features into indices, which can
then be fed into embedding layers.


```python
lookup_layers = {}
lookup_layers.update(
    {
        feature: keras.layers.IntegerLookup(vocabulary=vocabularies[feature])
        for feature in MOVIELENS_CONFIG["int_features"]
    }
)
lookup_layers.update(
    {
        feature: keras.layers.StringLookup(vocabulary=vocabularies[feature])
        for feature in MOVIELENS_CONFIG["str_features"]
    }
)

ratings_ds = ratings_ds.map(
    lambda x, y: (
        {
            feature_name: lookup_layers[feature_name](x[feature_name])
            for feature_name in vocabularies
        },
        y,
    )
)
```

Let's split our data into train and test sets. We also use `cache()` and
`prefetch()` for better performance.


```python
ratings_ds = ratings_ds.shuffle(100_000)

train_ds = (
    ratings_ds.take(80_000)
    .batch(MOVIELENS_CONFIG["batch_size"])
    .cache()
    .prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
)
test_ds = (
    ratings_ds.skip(80_000)
    .batch(MOVIELENS_CONFIG["batch_size"])
    .take(20_000)
    .cache()
    .prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
)
```

### Building the model

The model will have embedding layers, followed by cross and/or feedforward
layers.


```python

def get_model(
    dense_num_units_lst,
    embedding_dim=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["embedding_dim"],
    use_cross_layer=False,
    projection_dim=None,
):
    inputs = {}
    embeddings = []
    for feature_name, vocabulary in vocabularies.items():
        inputs[feature_name] = keras.Input(shape=(), dtype="int32", name=feature_name)
        embedding_layer = keras.layers.Embedding(
            input_dim=len(vocabulary) + 1,
            output_dim=embedding_dim,
        )
        embedding = embedding_layer(inputs[feature_name])
        embeddings.append(embedding)

    x = keras.ops.concatenate(embeddings, axis=1)

    # Cross layer.
    if use_cross_layer:
        x = keras_rs.layers.FeatureCross(projection_dim=projection_dim)(x)

    # Dense layer.
    for num_units in dense_num_units_lst:
        x = keras.layers.Dense(num_units, activation="relu")(x)

    x = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)

    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

```

We have three models - a deep cross network, an optimised deep cross
network with a low-rank matrix (to reduce training and serving costs) and a
normal deep network without cross layers. The deep cross network is a stacked
DCN model, i.e., the inputs are fed to cross layers, followed by feedforward
layers.  Let's run each model 10 times, and report the average/standard
deviation of the RMSE.


```python
cross_network_rmse_list = []
opt_cross_network_rmse_list = []
deep_network_rmse_list = []

for _ in range(10):
    cross_network = get_model(
        dense_num_units_lst=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["dcn_num_units"],
        embedding_dim=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["embedding_dim"],
        use_cross_layer=True,
    )
    rmse, cross_network_num_params = train_and_evaluate(
        learning_rate=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["learning_rate"],
        epochs=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["num_epochs"],
        train_data=train_ds,
        test_data=test_ds,
        model=cross_network,
    )
    cross_network_rmse_list.append(rmse)

    opt_cross_network = get_model(
        dense_num_units_lst=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["dcn_num_units"],
        embedding_dim=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["embedding_dim"],
        use_cross_layer=True,
        projection_dim=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["projection_dim"],
    )
    rmse, opt_cross_network_num_params = train_and_evaluate(
        learning_rate=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["learning_rate"],
        epochs=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["num_epochs"],
        train_data=train_ds,
        test_data=test_ds,
        model=opt_cross_network,
    )
    opt_cross_network_rmse_list.append(rmse)

    deep_network = get_model(dense_num_units_lst=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["deep_net_num_units"])
    rmse, deep_network_num_params = train_and_evaluate(
        learning_rate=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["learning_rate"],
        epochs=MOVIELENS_CONFIG["num_epochs"],
        train_data=train_ds,
        test_data=test_ds,
        model=deep_network,
    )
    deep_network_rmse_list.append(rmse)

print_stats(
    rmse_list=cross_network_rmse_list,
    num_params=cross_network_num_params,
    model_name="Cross Network",
)
print_stats(
    rmse_list=opt_cross_network_rmse_list,
    num_params=opt_cross_network_num_params,
    model_name="Optimised Cross Network",
)
print_stats(
    rmse_list=deep_network_rmse_list,
    num_params=deep_network_num_params,
    model_name="Deep Network",
)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Cross Network: RMSE = 0.8887265503406525 ± 0.02188869864935667; #params = 221953

DCN outperforms a similarly sized DNN with ReLU layers, demonstrating
superior performance. Furthermore, the low-rank DCN effectively reduces the
number of parameters without compromising accuracy.

### Visualizing feature interactions

Like we did for the toy example, we will plot the weight matrix of the cross
layer to see which feature crosses are important. In the previous example,
the importance of interactions between the `i`-th and `j-th` features is
captured by the `(i, j)`-{th} element of the weight matrix.

In this case, the feature embeddings are of size 32 rather than 1. Therefore,
the importance of feature interactions is represented by the `(i, j)`-th
block of the weight matrix, which has dimensions `32 x 32`. To quantify the
significance of these interactions, we use the Frobenius norm of each block. A
larger value implies higher importance.


```python
features = list(vocabularies.keys())
mat = cross_network.weights[len(features)].numpy()
embedding_dim = MOVIELENS_CONFIG["embedding_dim"]

block_norm = np.zeros([len(features), len(features)])

# Compute the norms of the blocks.
for i in range(len(features)):
    for j in range(len(features)):
        block = mat[
            i * embedding_dim : (i + 1) * embedding_dim,
            j * embedding_dim : (j + 1) * embedding_dim,
        ]
        block_norm[i, j] = np.linalg.norm(block, ord="fro")

visualize_layer(
    matrix=block_norm,
    features=features,
)
```
