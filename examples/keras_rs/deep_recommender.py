## Introduction

One of the great advantages of using Keras to build recommender models is the
freedom to build rich, flexible feature representations.

The first step in doing so is preparing the features, as raw features will
usually not be immediately usable in a model.

For example:
- User and item IDs may be strings (titles, usernames) or large, non-contiguous
  integers (database IDs).
- Item descriptions could be raw text.
- Interaction timestamps could be raw Unix timestamps.

These need to be appropriately transformed in order to be useful in building
models:
- User and item IDs have to be translated into embedding vectors,
  high-dimensional numerical representations that are adjusted during training
  to help the model predict its objective better.
- Raw text needs to be tokenized (split into smaller parts such as individual
  words) and translated into embeddings.
- Numerical features need to be normalized so that their values lie in a small
  interval around 0.

Fortunately, the Keras
[`FeatureSpace`](/api/utils/feature_space/) utility makes this
preprocessing easy.

In this tutorial, we are going to incorporate multiple features in our models.
These features will come from preprocessing the MovieLens dataset.

In the
[basic retrieval](/keras_rs/examples/basic_retrieval/)
tutorial, the models consist of only an embedding layer. In this tutorial, we
add more dense layers to our models to increase their expressive power.

In general, deeper models are capable of learning more complex patterns than
shallower models. For example, our user model incorporates user IDs and user
features such as age, gender and occupation. A shallow model (say, a single
embedding layer) may only be able to learn the simplest relationships between
those features and movies: a given user generally prefers horror movies to
comedies. To capture more complex relationships, such as user preferences
evolving with their age, we may need a deeper model with multiple stacked dense
layers.

Of course, complex models also have their disadvantages. The first is
computational cost, as larger models require both more memory and more
computation to train and serve. The second is the requirement for more data. In
general, more training data is needed to take advantage of deeper models. With
more parameters, deep models might overfit or even simply memorize the training
examples instead of learning a function that can generalize. Finally, training
deeper models may be harder, and more care needs to be taken in choosing
settings like regularization and learning rate.

Finding a good architecture for a real-world recommender system is a complex
art, requiring good intuition and careful hyperparameter tuning. For example,
factors such as the depth and width of the model, activation function, learning
rate, and optimizer can radically change the performance of the model. Modelling
choices are further complicated by the fact that good offline evaluation metrics
may not correspond to good online performance, and that the choice of what to
optimize for is often more critical than the choice of model itself.

Nevertheless, effort put into building and fine-tuning larger models often pays
off. In this tutorial, we will illustrate how to build a deep retrieval model.
We'll do this by building progressively more complex models to see how this
affects model performance.

"""

MOVIES_COUNT = movies.cardinality().numpy()

"""
## Preprocessing the dataset

### Normalizing continuous features

Continuous features may need normalization so that they fall within an
acceptable range for the model. We will give two examples of such normalization.

#### Discretization

A common transformation is to turn a continuous feature into a number of
categorical features. This makes good sense if we have reasons to suspect that a
feature's effect is non-continuous.

We need to decide on a number the buckets we will use for discretization. Then,
we will use the Keras `FeatureSpace` utility to automatically find the minimum
and maximum value, and divide that range by the number of buckets to perform the
discretization.

In this example, we will discretize the user age.
"""

AGE_BINS_COUNT = 10
user_age_feature = keras.utils.FeatureSpace.float_discretized(
    num_bins=AGE_BINS_COUNT, output_mode="int"
)

"""
#### Rescaling

Often, we want continous features to be between 0 and 1, or between -1 and 1.
To achieve this, we can rescale features that have a different range.

In this example, we will standardize the rating, which is a integer between 1
and 5, to be a float between 0 and 1. We need to rescale it and offset it.
"""

user_rating_feature = keras.utils.FeatureSpace.float_rescaled(
    scale=1.0 / 4.0, offset=-1.0 / 4.0
)

"""
### Turning categorical features into embeddings

A categorical feature is a feature that does not express a continuous quantity,
but rather takes on one of a set of fixed values.

Most deep learning models express these feature by turning them into
high-dimensional vectors. During model training, the value of that vector is
adjusted to help the model predict its objective better.

For example, suppose that our goal is to predict which user is going to watch
which movie. To do that, we represent each user and each movie by an embedding
vector. Initially, these embeddings will take on random values. During training,
we adjust them so that embeddings of users and the movies they watch end up
closer together.

Taking raw categorical features and turning them into embeddings is normally a
two-step process:
1. First, we need to translate the raw values into a range of contiguous
   integers, normally by building a mapping (called a "vocabulary") that maps
   raw values to integers.
2. Second, we need to take these integers and turn them into embeddings.
"""

"""
#### Defining categorical features

We will use the Keras `FeatureSpace` utility for the first step. Its `adapt`
method automatically discovers the vocabulary for categorical features.
"""

user_gender_feature = keras.utils.FeatureSpace.integer_categorical(
    num_oov_indices=0, output_mode="int"
)
user_occupation_feature = keras.utils.FeatureSpace.integer_categorical(
    num_oov_indices=0, output_mode="int"
)

"""
#### Using feature crosses

With crosses we can do feature interactions between multiple categorical
features.  This can be powerful to express that the combination of features
represents a specific taste for movies.

Note that the combination of multiple features can result into on a super large
feature space, that is why the crossing_dim parameter is important to limit the
output dimension of the cross feature.

In this example, we will cross age and gender with the Keras `FeatureSpace`
utility.
"""

USER_GENDER_CROSS_COUNT = 20
user_gender_age_cross = keras.utils.FeatureSpace.cross(
    feature_names=("user_gender", "raw_user_age"),
    crossing_dim=USER_GENDER_CROSS_COUNT,
    output_mode="int",
)

"""
### Processing text features

We may also want to add text features to our model. Usually, things like product
descriptions are free form text, and we can hope that our model can learn to use
the information they contain to make better recommendations, especially in a
cold-start or long tail scenario.

While the MovieLens dataset does not give us rich textual features, we can still
use movie titles. This may help us capture the fact that movies with very
similar titles are likely to belong to the same series.

The first transformation we need to apply to text is tokenization (splitting
into constituent words or word-pieces), followed by vocabulary learning,
followed by an embedding.


The
[`keras.layers.TextVectorization`](/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/text/text_vectorization/)
layer can do the first two steps for us.
"""

title_vectorizer = keras.layers.TextVectorization(
    max_tokens=10_000, output_sequence_length=16, dtype="int32"
)
title_vectorizer.adapt(movies.map(lambda x: x["movie_title"]))

"""
Let's try it out:
"""

for data in movies.take(1).as_numpy_iterator():
    print(title_vectorizer(data["movie_title"]))

"""
Each title is translated into a sequence of tokens, one for each piece we've
tokenized.

We can check the learned vocabulary to verify that the layer is using the
correct tokenization:
"""

print(title_vectorizer.get_vocabulary()[40:50])

"""
This looks correct, the layer is tokenizing titles into individual words. Later,
we will see how to embed this tokenized text. For now, we turn this vectorizer
into a Keras `FeatureSpace` feature.
"""

title_feature = keras.utils.FeatureSpace.feature(
    preprocessor=title_vectorizer, dtype="string", output_mode="float"
)
TITLE_TOKEN_COUNT = title_vectorizer.vocabulary_size()

"""
### Putting the FeatureSpace features together

We're now ready to assemble the features with preprocessors in a `FeatureSpace`
object. We're then using `adapt` to go through the dataset and learn what needs
to be learned, such as the vocabulary size for categorical features or the
minimum and maximum values for bucketized features.

## Pre-building the candidate set

Our model is going to based on a `Retrieval` layer, which can provides a set of
best candidates among to full set of candidates. To do this, the retrieval layer
needs to know all the candidates and their features. In this section, we
assemble the full set of movies with the associated features.

### Extract raw candidate features

First, we gather all the raw features from the dataset in lists. That is the
titles of the movies and the genres. Note that one or more genres are
associated with each movie, and the number of genres varies per movie.

### Preprocess candidate features

Genres are already in the form of category numbers starting at zero. However, we
do need to figure out two things:
- The maximum number of genres a single movie can have; this will determine the
  dimension for this feature.
- The maximum value for the genre, which will give us the total number of genres
  and determine the size of our embedding table for genres.

Now we need to pad genres with an Out Of Vocabulary value to be able to
represent genres as a fixed size vector. We'll pad with zeros for simplicity, so
we're adding one to the genres to not conflict with genre zero, which is a valid
genre.

everything is a native tensor that can be consumed by the retrieval layer.

## Model definition

### Query model

The query model is first tasked with converting user features to embeddings. The
embeddings are then concatenated into a single vector.

Defining deeper models will require us to stack more layers on top of this first
set of embeddings. A progressively narrower stack of layers, separated by an
activation function, is a common pattern:

```
                            +----------------------+
                            |       64 x 32        |
                            +----------------------+
                                       | relu
                          +--------------------------+
                          |         128 x 64         |
                          +--------------------------+
                                       | relu
                        +------------------------------+
                        |          ... x 128           |
                        +------------------------------+
```

Since the expressive power of deep linear models is no greater than that of
shallow linear models, we use ReLU activations for all but the last hidden
layer. The final hidden layer does not use any activation function: using an
activation function would limit the output space of the final embeddings and
might negatively impact the performance of the model. For instance, if ReLUs are
used in the projection layer, all components in the output embedding would be
non-negative.

We're going to try this here. To make experimentation with different depths
easy, let's define a model whose depth (and width) is defined by a constructor
parameters. The `layer_sizes` parameter gives us the depth and width of the
model. We can vary it to experiment with shallower or deeper models.

"""
This is a good illustration of the fact that deeper and larger models, while
capable of superior performance, often require very careful tuning. For example,
throughout this tutorial we used a single, fixed learning rate. Alternative
choices may give very different results and are worth exploring.

With appropriate tuning and sufficient data, the effort put into building larger
and deeper models is in many cases well worth it: larger models can lead to
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy.

## Next Steps

In this tutorial we expanded our retrieval model with dense layers and
activation functions. To see how to create a model that can perform not only
retrieval tasks but also rating tasks, take a look at the multitask tutorial.
