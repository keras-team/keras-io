    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are often composed of two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The retrieval stage is responsible for selecting an initial set of hundreds\n",
    "   of candidates from all possible candidates. The main objective of this model\n",
    "   is to efficiently weed out all candidates that the user is not interested in.\n",
    "   Because the retrieval model may be dealing with millions of candidates, it\n",
    "   has to be computationally efficient.\n",
    "2. The ranking stage takes the outputs of the retrieval model and fine-tunes\n",
    "   them to select the best possible handful of recommendations. Its task is to\n",
    "   narrow down the set of items the user may be interested in to a shortlist of\n",
    "   likely candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to focus on the first stage, retrieval. If you are\n",
    "interested in the ranking stage, have a look at our\n",
    "[ranking](/keras_rs/examples/basic_ranking/) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval models are often composed of two sub-models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A query tower computing the query representation (normally a\n",
    "   fixed-dimensionality embedding vector) using query features.\n",
    "2. A candidate tower computing the candidate representation (an equally-sized\n",
    "   vector) using the candidate features. The outputs of the two models are then\n",
    "   multiplied together to give a query-candidate affinity score, with higher\n",
    "   scores expressing a better match between the candidate and the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to build and train such a two-tower model using\n",
    "the Movielens dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get our data and split it into a training and test set.\n",
    "2. Implement a retrieval model.\n",
    "3. Fit and evaluate it.\n",
    "4. Test running predictions with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Movielens dataset is a classic dataset from the\n",
    "[GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) research group at the\n",
    "University of Minnesota. It contains a set of ratings given to movies by a set\n",
    "of users, and is a standard for recommender systems research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be treated in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be interpreted as expressesing which movies the users watched (and\n",
    "   rated), and which they did not. This is a form of implicit feedback, where\n",
    "   users' watches tell us which things they prefer to see and which they'd\n",
    "   rather not see.\n",
    "2. It can also be seen as expressesing how much the users liked the movies they\n",
    "   did watch. This is a form of explicit feedback: given that a user watched a\n",
    "   movie, we can tell how much they liked by looking at the rating they have\n",
    "   given.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are focusing on a retrieval system: a model that predicts a\n",
    "set of movies from the catalogue that the user is likely to watch. For this, the\n",
    "model will try to predict the rating users would give to all the movies in the\n",
    "catalogue. We will therefore use the explicit rating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by choosing JAX as the backend we want to run on, and import all\n",
    "the necessary libraries."

    "## Implementing the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the architecture of our model is a key part of modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are building a two-tower retrieval model, therefore we need to combine a\n",
    "query tower for users and a candidate tower for movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to decide on the dimensionality of the query and candidate\n",
    "representations. This is the `embedding_dimension` argument in our model\n",
    "constructor. We'll test with a value of `32`. Higher values will correspond to\n",
    "models that may be more accurate, but will also be slower to fit and more prone\n",
    "to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query and Candidate Towers\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to define the model itself. In this simple example, the query\n",
    "tower and candidate tower are simply embeddings with nothing else. We'll use\n",
    "Keras' `Embedding` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily extend the towers to make them arbitrarily complex using standard\n",
    "Keras components, as long as we return an `embedding_dimension`-wide output at\n",
    "the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieval itself will be performed by `BruteForceRetrieval` layer from Keras\n",
    "Recommenders. This layer computes the affinity scores for the given users and\n",
    "all the candidate movies, then returns the top K in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that during training, we don't actually need to perform any retrieval since\n",
    "the only affinity scores we need are the ones for the users and movies in the\n",
    "batch. As an optimization, we skip the retrieval entirely in the `call` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The next component is the loss used to train our model. In this case, we use a\n",
    "mean square error loss to measure the difference between the predicted movie\n",
    "ratings and the actual ratins from users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we override `compute_loss` from the `keras.Model` class. This allows\n",
    "us to compute the query-candidate affinity score, which is obtained by\n",
    "multiplying the outputs of the two towers together. That affinity score can then\n",
