    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great advantages of using Keras to build recommender models is the\n",
    "freedom to build rich, flexible feature representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in doing so is preparing the features, as raw features will\n",
    "usually not be immediately usable in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- User and item IDs may be strings (titles, usernames) or large, non-contiguous\n",
    "  integers (database IDs).\n",
    "- Item descriptions could be raw text.\n",
    "- Interaction timestamps could be raw Unix timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These need to be appropriately transformed in order to be useful in building\n",
    "models:\n",
    "- User and item IDs have to be translated into embedding vectors,\n",
    "  high-dimensional numerical representations that are adjusted during training\n",
    "  to help the model predict its objective better.\n",
    "- Raw text needs to be tokenized (split into smaller parts such as individual\n",
    "  words) and translated into embeddings.\n",
    "- Numerical features need to be normalized so that their values lie in a small\n",
    "  interval around 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the Keras\n",
    "[`FeatureSpace`](/api/utils/feature_space/) utility makes this\n",
    "preprocessing easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to incorporate multiple features in our models.\n",
    "These features will come from preprocessing the MovieLens dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the\n",
    "[basic retrieval](/keras_rs/examples/basic_retrieval/)\n",
    "tutorial, the models consist of only an embedding layer. In this tutorial, we\n",
    "add more dense layers to our models to increase their expressive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, deeper models are capable of learning more complex patterns than\n",
    "shallower models. For example, our user model incorporates user IDs and user\n",
    "features such as age, gender and occupation. A shallow model (say, a single\n",
    "embedding layer) may only be able to learn the simplest relationships between\n",
    "those features and movies: a given user generally prefers horror movies to\n",
    "comedies. To capture more complex relationships, such as user preferences\n",
    "evolving with their age, we may need a deeper model with multiple stacked dense\n",
    "layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, complex models also have their disadvantages. The first is\n",
    "computational cost, as larger models require both more memory and more\n",
    "computation to train and serve. The second is the requirement for more data. In\n",
    "general, more training data is needed to take advantage of deeper models. With\n",
    "more parameters, deep models might overfit or even simply memorize the training\n",
    "examples instead of learning a function that can generalize. Finally, training\n",
    "deeper models may be harder, and more care needs to be taken in choosing\n",
    "settings like regularization and learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a good architecture for a real-world recommender system is a complex\n",
    "art, requiring good intuition and careful hyperparameter tuning. For example,\n",
    "factors such as the depth and width of the model, activation function, learning\n",
    "rate, and optimizer can radically change the performance of the model. Modelling\n",
    "choices are further complicated by the fact that good offline evaluation metrics\n",
    "may not correspond to good online performance, and that the choice of what to\n",
    "optimize for is often more critical than the choice of model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, effort put into building and fine-tuning larger models often pays\n",
    "off. In this tutorial, we will illustrate how to build a deep retrieval model.\n",
    "We'll do this by building progressively more complex models to see how this\n",
    "affects model performance."
