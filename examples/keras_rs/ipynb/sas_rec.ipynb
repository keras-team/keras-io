    "    - taking the original `example[\"sequence\"]` and creating the model's\n",
    "      input features (`item_ids`) from all items *except the last one*\n",
    "      (`example[\"sequence\"][..., :-1]`);\n",
    "    - creating the target \"positive sequence\" (what the model tries to predict\n",
    "      as the actual next items) by taking the original `example[\"sequence\"]`\n",
    "      and shifting it, using all items *except the first one*\n",
    "      (`example[\"sequence\"][..., 1:]`);\n",
    "    - shifting `example[\"negative_sequence\"]` (from `format_data`) is\n",
    "      to create the target \"negative sequence\" for the contrastive loss\n",
    "      (`example[\"negative_sequence\"][..., 1:]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Handling Variable Length Sequences: Neural networks typically require\n",
    "    fixed-size inputs. Therefore, both the input feature sequences and the\n",
    "    target sequences are padded (with a special `PAD_ITEM_ID`) or truncated\n",
    "    to a predefined `MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH`. A `padding_mask` is also generated\n",
    "    from the input features to ensure the model ignores these padded tokens\n",
    "    during attention calculations, i.e, these tokens will be masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Differentiating Training and Validation/Testing:\n",
    "    - During training:\n",
    "      - Input features (`item_ids`) and context for negative sequences\n",
    "        are prepared as described above (all but the last item of the\n",
    "        original sequences).\n",
    "      - Target positive and negative sequences are the shifted versions of\n",
    "        the original sequences.\n",
    "        - `sample_weight` is created based on the input features to ensure\n",
    "          that loss is calculated only on actual items, not on padding tokens\n",
    "          in the targets.\n",
    "    - During validation/testing:\n",
    "      - Input features are prepared similarly.\n",
    "      - The model's performance is typically evaluated on its ability to\n",
    "        predict the actual last item of the original sequence. Thus,\n",
    "        `sample_weight` is configured to focus the loss calculation\n",
    "        only on this final prediction in the target sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: SASRec does the same thing we've done above, except that they take the\n",
    "`item_ids[:-2]` for the validation set and `item_ids[:-1]` for the test set.\n",

    "likely watch after watching the last movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's worth discussing the `compute_loss` method. We embed the positive\n",
    "and negative sequences using the input embedding matrix. We compute the\n",
    "similarity of (positive sequence, input sequence) and (negative sequence,\n",
    "input sequence) pair embeddings by computing the dot product. The goal now is\n",
