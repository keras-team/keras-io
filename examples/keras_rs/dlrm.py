## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) to
effectively learn the relationships between items and user preferences using a
dot-product interaction mechanism. For more details, please refer to the
[DLRM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00091) paper.

DLRM is designed to excel at capturing explicit, bounded-degree feature interactions and
is particularly effective at processing both categorical and continuous (sparse/dense)
input features. The architecture consists of three main components: dedicated input
layers to handle diverse features, a dot-product interaction layer to explicitly model 
feature interactions, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to capture implicit feature relationships.

The dot-product interaction layer lies at the heart of DLRM, efficiently computing
pairwise interactions between different feature embeddings. This contrasts with models
like Deep & Cross Network (DCN), which can treat elements within a feature vector as
independent units, potentially leading to a higher-dimensional space and increased
computational cost. The MLP is a standard feedforward network. The DLRM is formed by
combining the interaction layer and MLP.

The following image illustrates the DLRM architecture:

![DLRM Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kharshith-k/keras-io/refs/heads/keras-rs-examples/examples/keras_rs/img/dlrm/dlrm_architecture.gif)

Now that we have a foundational understanding of DLRM's architecture and key
characteristics, let's dive into the code. We will train a DLRM on a real-world dataset
to demonstrate its capability to learn meaningful feature interactions. Let's begin by
setting the backend to JAX and organizing our imports.

### Visualizing feature interactions

The DotInteraction layer itself doesn't have a conventional "weight" matrix like a Dense
layer. Instead, its function is to compute the dot product between the embedding vectors
of your features.

To visualize the strength of these interactions, we can calculate a matrix representing
the pairwise interaction strength between all feature embeddings. A common way to do this
is to take the dot product of the embedding matrices for each pair of features and then
aggregate the result into a single value (like the mean of the absolute values) that
represents the overall interaction strength.
