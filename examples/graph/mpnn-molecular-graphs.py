Description: Implementation of an MPNN to predict blood-brain barrier permeability.
"""
"""
## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will implement a type of graph neural network (GNN) known as
_ message passing neural network_ (MPNN) to predict graph properties. Specifically, we will
implement an MPNN to predict a molecular property known as
_blood-brain barrier permeability_ (BBBP).

Motivation: as molecules are naturally represented as an undirected graph `G = (V, E)`,
where `V` is a set or vertices (nodes; atoms) and `E` a set of edges (bonds), GNNs (such
as MPNN) are proving to be a useful method for predicting molecular properties.

Until now, more traditional methods, such as random forests, support vector machines, etc.,
have been commonly used to predict molecular properties. In contrast to GNNs, these
traditional approaches often operate on precomputed molecular features such as
molecular weight, polarity, charge, number of carbon atoms, etc. Although these
molecular features prove to be good predictors for various molecular properties, it is
hypothesized that operating on these more "raw", "low-level", features could prove even
better.

In recent years, a lot of effort has been put into developing neural networks for
graph data, including molecular graphs. For a summary of graph neural networks, see e.g.,

## Setup

### Install RDKit and other dependencies

(Text below taken from
[this tutorial](https://keras.io/examples/generative/wgan-graphs/)).

[RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) is a collection of cheminformatics and machine-learning
software written in C++ and Python. In this tutorial, RDKit is used to conveniently and
efficiently transform
[SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) to
molecule objects, and then from those obtain sets of atoms and bonds.

SMILES expresses the structure of a given molecule in the form of an ASCII string.
The SMILES string is a compact encoding which, for smaller molecules, is relatively
human-readable. Encoding molecules as a string both alleviates and facilitates database
and/or web searching of a given molecule. RDKit uses algorithms to
accurately transform a given SMILES to a molecule object, which can then
be used to compute a great number of molecular properties/features.

Notice, RDKit is commonly installed via [Conda](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html).
However, thanks to
[rdkit_platform_wheels](https://github.com/kuelumbus/rdkit_platform_wheels), rdkit
can now (for the sake of this tutorial) be installed easily via pip, as follows:

```
pip -q install rdkit-pypi
```

And for easy and efficient reading of csv files and visualization, the below needs to be
installed:

```
pip -q install pandas
pip -q install Pillow
pip -q install matplotlib
pip -q install pydot
sudo apt-get -qq install graphviz
```

## Dataset

Information about the dataset can be found in
[A Bayesian Approach to in Silico Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration Modeling](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci300124c)
and [MoleculeNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564).
The dataset will be downloaded from [MoleculeNet.org](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1).

### About

The dataset contains **2,050** molecules. Each molecule come with a **name**, **label**
and **SMILES** string.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a membrane separating the blood from the brain
extracellular fluid, hence blocking out most drugs (molecules) from reaching
the brain. Because of this, the BBBP has been important to study for the development of
new drugs that aim to target the central nervous system. The labels for this
data set are binary (1 or 0) and indicate the permeability of the molecules.

### Define features

To encode features for atoms and bonds (which we will need later),
we'll define two classes: `AtomFeaturizer` and `BondFeaturizer` respectively.

To reduce the lines of code, i.e., to keep this tutorial short and concise,
only about a handful of (atom and bond) features will be considered: \[atom features\]
[symbol (element)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element),
[number of valence electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron),
[number of hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen),
[orbital hybridization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_hybridisation),
\[bond features\]
[(covalent) bond type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond), and
[conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system).

### Generate graphs

Before we can generate complete graphs from SMILES, we need to implement the following functions:

1. `molecule_from_smiles`, which takes as input a SMILES and returns a molecule object.
This is all handled by RDKit.

2. `graph_from_molecule`, which takes as input a molecule object and returns a graph,
represented as a three-tuple (atom_features, bond_features, pair_indices). For this we
will make use of the classes defined previously.

Finally, we can now implement the function `graphs_from_smiles`, which applies function (1)
and subsequently (2) on all SMILES of the training, validation and test datasets.

Notice: although scaffold splitting is recommended for this data set (see
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564)), for simplicity, simple random splittings were
performed.

## Model

The MPNN model can take on various shapes and forms. In this tutorial, we will implement an
MPNN based on the original paper
[Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) and
[DeepChem's MPNNModel](https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/models.html#mpnnmodel).
The MPNN of this tutorial consists of three stages: message passing, readout and
classification.


### Message passing

The message passing step itself consists of two parts:

1. The *edge network*, which passes messages from 1-hop neighbors `w_{i}` of `v`
to `v`, based on the edge features between them (`e_{vw_{i}}`),
resulting in an updated node (state) `v'`. `w_{i}` denotes the `i:th` neighbor of
`v`.

2. The *gated recurrent unit* (GRU), which takes as input the most recent node state
and updates it based on previous node states. In
other words, the most recent node state serves as the input to the GRU, while the previous
node states are incorporated within the memory state of the GRU. This allows information
to travel from one node state (e.g., `v`) to another (e.g., `v''`).

Importantly, step (1) and (2) are repeated for `k steps`, and where at each step `1...k`,
the radius (or number of hops) of aggregated information from `v` increases by 1.

### Readout

When the message passing procedure ends, the k-step-aggregated node states are to be partitioned
into subgraphs (correspoding to each molecule in the batch) and subsequently
reduced to graph-level embeddings. In the
[original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212), a
[set-to-set layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06391) was used for this purpose.
In this tutorial however, a transformer encoder + average pooling will be used. Specifically:

* the k-step-aggregated node states will be partitioned into the subgraphs
(corresponding to each molecule in the batch);
* each subgraph will then be padded to match the subgraph with the greatest number of nodes, followed
by a `tf.stack(...)`;
* the (stacked padded) tensor, encoding subgraphs (each subgraph containing a set of node states), are
masked to make sure the paddings don't interfere with training;
* finally, the tensor is passed to the transformer followed by average pooling.

## Conclusions

In this tutorial, we demonstarted a message passing neural network (MPNN) to
predict blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) for a number of different molecules. We
first had to construct graphs from SMILES, then build a Keras model that could
operate on these graphs, and finally train the model to make the predictions.
