## Introduction

[TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests)
is a collection of state-of-the-art algorithms of Decision Forest models
that are compatible with Keras APIs.
The models include [Random Forests](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/api_docs/python/tfdf/keras/RandomForestModel),
[Gradient Boosted Trees](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/api_docs/python/tfdf/keras/GradientBoostedTreesModel),
and [CART](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/api_docs/python/tfdf/keras/CartModel),
and can be used for regression, classification, and ranking task.
For a beginner's guide to TensorFlow Decision Forests,
please refer to this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tutorials/beginner_colab).


This example uses Gradient Boosted Trees model in binary classification of
structured data, and covers the following scenarios:

1. Build a decision forests model by specifying the input feature usage.
2. Implement a custom *Binary Target encoder* as a [Keras Preprocessing layer](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/)
to encode the categorical features with respect to their target value co-occurrences,
and then use the encoded features to build a decision forests model.
3. Encode the categorical features as [embeddings](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/embedding),
train these embeddings in a simple NN model, and then use the
trained embeddings as inputs to build decision forests model.

This example uses TensorFlow 2.7 or higher,
as well as [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests),
which you can install using the following command:

```python
pip install -U tensorflow_decision_forests
```

## Experiment 2: Decision Forests with target encoding

[Target encoding](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/507533.507538) is a common preprocessing
technique for categorical features that convert them into numerical features.
Using categorical features with high cardinality as-is may lead to overfitting.
Target encoding aims to replace each categorical feature value with one or more
numerical values that represent its co-occurrence with the target labels.

More precisely, given a categorical feature, the binary target encoder in this example
will produce three new numerical features:

1. `positive_frequency`: How many times each feature value occurred with a positive target label.
2. `negative_frequency`: How many times each feature value occurred with a negative target label.
3. `positive_probability`: The probability that the target label is positive,
given the feature value, which is computed as
`positive_frequency / (positive_frequency + negative_frequency + correction)`.
The `correction` term is added in to make the division more stable for rare categorical values.
The default value for `correction` is 1.0.



Note that target encoding is effective with models that cannot automatically
learn dense representations to categorical features, such as decision forests
or kernel methods. If neural network models are used, its recommended to
encode categorical features as embeddings.
"""

"""
### Implement Binary Target Encoder

For simplicity, we assume that the inputs for the `adapt` and `call` methods
are in the expected data types and shapes, so no validation logic is added.

It is recommended to pass the `vocabulary_size` of the categorical feature to the
`BinaryTargetEncoding` constructor. If not specified, it will be computed during
the `adapt()` method execution.

## Concluding remarks

TensorFlow Decision Forests provide powerful models, especially with structured data.
In our experiments, the Gradient Boosted Tree model achieved 95.79% test accuracy.
When using the target encoding with categorical feature, the same model achieved 95.81% test accuracy.
When pretraining embeddings to be used as inputs to the Gradient Boosted Tree model,
we achieved 95.82% test accuracy.

Decision Forests can be used with Neural Networks, either by
1) using Neural Networks to learn useful representation of the input data,
and then using Decision Forests for the supervised learning task, or by
2) creating an ensemble of both Decision Forests and Neural Network models.

Note that TensorFlow Decision Forests does not (yet) support hardware accelerators.
All training and inference is done on the CPU.
Besides, Decision Forests require a finite dataset that fits in memory
for their training procedures. However, there are diminishing returns
for increasing the size of the dataset, and Decision Forests algorithms
arguably need fewer examples for convergence than large Neural Network models.
